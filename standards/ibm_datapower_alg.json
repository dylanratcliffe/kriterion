The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary.",

The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data.\n\nInformation flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but is being transported to an unapproved destination.\n\nALGs enforce approved authorizations by employing security policy and/or rules that restrict information system services, provide packet filtering capability based on header or protocol information and/or message filtering capability based on data content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).",

Information flow restrictions may be implemented based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.\n\nThe ALG must be configured with policy filters (e.g., security policy, rules, and/or signatures) that restrict or block information system services; provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information; and/or perform message-filtering based on message content. The policy filters used depends upon the type of application gateway (e.g., web, email, or TLS).",

If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nThis requirement applies to gateways and firewalls that perform content inspection or have higher-layer proxy functionality.",

The audit storage on the ALG is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the centralized log server designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred. However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real time which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.\n\nThis does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).",
