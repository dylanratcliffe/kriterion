      "description": "Email system availability depends in part on best practices strategies for setting tuning configurations. The Global Recipient Count limit field is used to control the maximum number of recipients that can be specified in a single message sent from this server. Its primary purpose is to minimize the chance of an internal sender spamming other recipients, since SPAM messages often have a large number of recipients. SPAM prevention can originate from both outside and inside organizations. While inbound SPAM is evaluated as it arrives, controls such as this one help prevent SPAM that might originate inside the organization. \n\nThe Recipient Count Limit is global to the Exchange implementation. Lower-level refinements are possible; however, in this configuration strategy, setting the value once at the global level ensures a more available system by eliminating potential conflicts among multiple settings. A value of less than or equal to 5000 is probably larger than is needed for most organizations, but is small enough to minimize usefulness to spammers, and is easily handled by Exchange.  An unexpanded distribution is handled as one recipient.  Specifying “unlimited” may result in abuse.\n",

      "description": "Automated connection responses occur as a result of FTP or Telnet connections, when connecting to those services. They report a successful connection by greeting the connecting client, stating the name, release level, and (often) additional information regarding the responding product. While useful to the connecting client, connection responses can also be used by a third party to determine operating system (OS) or product release levels on the target server. The result can include disclosure of configuration information to third parties, paving the way for possible future attacks.   For example, when querying the SMTP service on port 25, the default response looks similar to this one: \n\n220 exchange.mydomain.org Microsoft ESMTP MAIL Service, Version: 6.0.3790.211 ready at Wed, 2 Feb 2005 23:40:00 -0500\n\nChanging the response to hide local configuration details reduces the attack profile of the target. \n",

This configuration controls the maximum number of simultaneous outbound connections from a domain, and works in conjunction with the Maximum Outbound Connections Count setting as a delivery tuning mechanism. If the limit is too low, connections may be dropped. If too high, some domains may use a disproportionate resource share, denying access to other domains. Appropriate tuning reduces risk of data delay or loss. \n\nBy default, a limit of 20 simultaneous outbound connections from a domain should be sufficient.

This configuration controls the number of idle minutes before the connection is dropped. It works in conjunction with the Maximum Outbound Connections Count setting.\n\nConnections, once established, may incur delays in message transfer.

Sluggish connectivity increases the risk of lost data. A value of 10 or less is optimal.\n",

There are several controls that work together to provide security between internal servers. This setting controls the encryption method used for communications between servers. With this feature enabled, only servers capable of supporting Transport Layer Security (TLS) will be able to send and receive mail within the domain.\n\nThe use of secure communication prevents eavesdroppers from reading or modifying communications between mail clients and servers. While sensitive message bodies should be encrypted by the sender at the client, requiring a secure connection from server to server adds protection by encrypting the sender and recipient information that cannot be encrypted by the sender. \n\nIndividually, channel security and encryption can be compromised by attackers. Used together, email becomes a more difficult target, and security is heightened. Failure to enable this feature gives eavesdroppers an opportunity to read or modify messages between servers.",
