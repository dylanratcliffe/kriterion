      "description": "Security related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system and include parameters related to the implementation of other IA controls. If these controls are not implemented, the system may be vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The use of an MDM allows an organization to assign values to security related parameters across all the devices it manages. This provides assurance that the required mobile OS security controls are being enforced, and that the device user or an adversary has not modified or disabled the controls. It also greatly increases efficiency and manageability of devices in a large scale environment relative to an environment in which each device must be configured separately.",

      "description": "The device lock function prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after a period of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user. The device lock is retained until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.\n\nA device lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work but does not want to shut down because of the temporary nature of the hiatus. During the device lock a publicly viewable pattern is visible on the associated display, hiding what was previously visible on the screen. Once invoked, the device lock shall remain in place until the user re-authenticates. No other system activity aside from re-authentication can unlock the system.\n\nThe operating system must lock the device after the organization defined time period. This prevents others from gaining access to the device when not in the user's possession and accessing sensitive DoD information. A device lock mitigates the risk that an adversary can access data on an unattended mobile device but only after the maximum of 15 minute period of inactivity.",

The modified configuration would enable an adversary with access to the device to obtain DoD information and possibly other information resources on other systems. An operating system that does not allow a user to disable this feature mitigates the risk of this attack. In cases in which the mobile operating system relies on another application for protected data storage (e.g., if FIPS 140-2 validated encryption for unclassified use is not native to the device), then this requirement applies to both the device lock password and the password to the data storage application.",
