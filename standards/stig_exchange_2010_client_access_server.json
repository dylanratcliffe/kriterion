This setting controls whether forms-based login should be used by the OWA web site. \n\nBecause the DoD requires Common Access Card (CAC)-based authentication to applications, OWA access must be brokered through an application proxy or other pre-authenticator, which performs CAC authentication prior to arrival at the CA server.  The authenticated request is then forwarded directly to OWA, where authentication is repeated without requiring the user to repeat authentication steps.  For this scenario to work, the Application Proxy server must have forms-based authentication enabled, and Exchange must have forms-based Authentication disabled.  \n\nIf forms-based Authentication is enabled on the Exchange CA server, it is evidence that the application proxy server is either not correctly configured, or it may be missing.",

The higher the level of detail, the more disk space required to store the audit material.\nDiagnostic logging is intended to help administrators debug problems with their systems, not as a general purpose auditing tool. Because the diagnostic logs collect a great deal of information, the log files may grow huge very quickly.
