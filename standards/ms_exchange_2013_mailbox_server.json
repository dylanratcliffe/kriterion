Diagnostic logging, however, characteristically produces large volumes of data and requires care in managing the logs to prevent risk of disk capacity denial-of-service conditions. \n\nExchange diagnostic logging is broken up into 29 main \"services\", each of which has anywhere from 2 to 26 \"categories\" of events to be monitored. Moreover, each category may be set to one of four levels of logging: Lowest, Low, Medium, and High, depending on how much detail one desires. The higher the level of detail, the more disk space required to store the audit material.\n\nDiagnostic logging is intended to help administrators debug problems with their systems, not as a general-purpose auditing tool. Because the diagnostic logs collect a great deal of information, the log files may grow large very quickly. Diagnostic log levels may be raised for limited periods of time when attempting to debug relevant pieces of Exchange functionality. Once debugging has finished, diagnostic log levels should be reduced again.",

If circular logging is enabled, there is one log file stored with a default size of 1024 KB. Once the size limit has been reached, additional log entries overwrite the oldest log entries. If circular logging is disabled, once a log file reaches the size limit, a new log file is created. \n\nMailbox should not use circular logging.

      "description": "Log files help establish a history of activities and can be useful in detecting attack attempts or determining tuning adjustments to improve availability. When “message tracking” is enabled, only the sender, recipients, time, and other delivery information are included by default. Information such as the subject and message body is not included.\n\nHowever, the absence of the message subject line can make it difficult to locate a specific message in the log unless one knows roughly what time the message was sent. To simplify searches through these logs, Exchange offers the ability to include the message “subject line” in the log files and in the Message Tracking Center display. This can make it significantly easier to locate a specific message.\n\nThis feature creates larger log files and will contain information that may raise privacy and legal concerns. Enterprise policy should be consulted before this feature is enabled. Also, since the log files may contain sensitive information in the form of the subject line, the log files will need to be protected, commensurate with the sensitivity level, as the content may be of interest to an attacker.  \n\nFor these reasons, it is recommended that subject logging not be enabled during regular production operations. Instead, treat this feature as a diagnostic that can be used if needed. The tradeoff is that finding the correct message in the message tracking logs will become more difficult since the administrator will need to search using only the time the message was sent and the message’s sender. This control will have no effect unless Message Tracking is enabled. However, the setting should be disabled in case message tracking is enabled in the future.",

A good rule of thumb (default) is to issue warnings when SMTP queue growth exceeds 10 minutes and critical messages when it exceeds 20 minutes, which should only exist occasionally. Frequent alerts against this counter may indicate a network or other issue (such as inbound ExchangeMER traffic) that directly impacts email delivery.   \n\nNotification choices include email alert to an email-enabled account (for example, an email Administrator) or invoke a script to take other action (for example, to add an Event to the Microsoft Application Event Log, where external monitors might detect it).",
