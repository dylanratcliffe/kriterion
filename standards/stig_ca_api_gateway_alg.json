      "description": "Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nThe CA API Gateway has the ability to integrate with third-party identity providers such as Active Directory. Users within the identity providers should be granted access to the Registered Services as needed through the use of policies within the Registered Services.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary.",

      "description": "Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network. The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data.\n\nInformation flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but being transported to an unapproved destination.\n\nUsing the CA API Gateway - Policy Manager, when creating polices to meet this requirement, the policies should be configured to leverage attributes from the ${request} variable, which contains information about the requesting client's IP address and identity, as well as message headers and body (content) that make up the request.\n\nThe CA API Gateway request message headers and content should be parsed and matched against regular expressions (regex) patterns for any text content, XPath expressions for XML content, and JSON path for JSON content relevant to the required flow of information.",

Blocking or restricting detected harmful or suspicious communications between interconnected networks enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of traffic.\n\nThis requirement applies to the flow of information between the CA API Gateway when used as a gateway or boundary device that allows traffic flow between interconnected networks of differing security policies.\n\nThe CA API Gateway should be installed and configured to restrict or block information flows based on guidance in the Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM) regarding restrictions for boundary crossing for ports, protocols, and services. Information flow restrictions may be implemented based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.\n\nThe CA API Gateway policies securing the Registered Services should include rules to control the flow of information between systems and networks with policy filters (e.g., rules that parse the Request Message attributes and/or signatures) that restrict or block information system services; provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information; and/or perform message filtering based on message content.",

By identifying and authenticating non-organizational users, their access to network resources can be restricted accordingly.\n\nNon-organizational users will be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization when related to the use of anonymous access. Authorization requires an individual account identifier that has been approved, assigned, and configured on an authentication server. Authentication of user identities is accomplished through the use of passwords, tokens, biometrics, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof.\n\nThis control applies to application layer gateways that provide content filtering and proxy services on network segments (e.g., DMZ) that allow access by non-organizational users. This requirement focuses on authentication requests to the proxied application for access to destination resources and policy filtering decisions, rather than administrator and management functions.\n\nThe CA API Gateway must provide for the use of an internal identity provider that can be used in conjunction with organizational directories such as Active Directory. The internal identity provider can be used for those users not explicitly defined within the organization or for users that exist outside of the organization.",

If the network does not provide safeguards against DoS attack, network resources will be unavailable to users.\n\nInstallation of an ALG at key boundaries in the architecture mitigates the risk of DoS attacks. These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.\n\nThe ALG must include protection against DoS attacks that originate from inside the enclave, which can affect either internal or external systems. These attacks may use legitimate or rogue endpoints from inside the enclave. These attacks can be simple \"floods\" of traffic to saturate circuits or devices, malware that consumes CPU and memory on a device or causes it to crash, or a configuration issue that disables or impairs the proper function of a device. For example, an accidental or deliberate misconfiguration of a routing table can misdirect traffic for multiple networks.\n\nTo comply with this requirement, the ALG must monitor outbound traffic for indications of known and unknown DoS attacks. Audit log capacity management, along with techniques that prevent the logging of redundant information during an attack, also guard against DoS attacks.\n\nThe CA API Gateway must enable an inbound rate limit in an effort to provide safeguards against DoS attacks. By default, this is not turned on and will need to be enabled either in Global Policy or within each Registered Service. Additionally, a quota can be inserted within a Registered Service's policy to verify that any request exceeding the quota for an authenticated user, client IP, etc. will be denied access to the Registered Service.

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nNetwork devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.

However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real time, which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.\n\nThis does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).\n\nBy default, when the CA API Gateway Server is configured to off-load audit records, they are offloaded in real time. No additional configuration is needed.",
