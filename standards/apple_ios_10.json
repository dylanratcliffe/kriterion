Having a too-long timeout would increase the window of opportunity for adversaries who gain physical access to the mobile device through loss, theft, etc. Such devices are much more likely to be in an unlocked state when acquired by an adversary, thus granting immediate access to the data on the mobile device. The maximum timeout period of 15 minutes has been selected to balance functionality and security; shorter timeout periods may be appropriate depending on the risks posed to the mobile device.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #01b",

The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #01a",

Setting a limit on the number of attempts mitigates this risk.

Passwords may also be a source of entropy for generation of key encryption or data encryption keys. If a password is not required to access data, this data is accessible to any adversary who obtains physical possession of the device. Requiring that a password be successfully entered before the mobile device data is unencrypted mitigates this risk.\n\nNote: MDF PP v2.0 requires a Password Authentication Factor and requires management of its length and complexity. It leaves open whether the existence of a password is subject to management.

For devices accommodating banners of 1300 characters, the banner text is: \n\nYou are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only. \nBy using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions: \n-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. \n-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS. \n-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose. \n-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy. \n-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.\n\nFor devices with severe character limitations, the banner text is: \n\nI've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't.\n\nThe administrator must configure the banner text exactly as written without any changes.\n\nSFR ID: FTA_TAB.1.1",

      "description": "DoD sensitive data (CUI/FOUO) or PII data downloaded from DoD web sites via Safari will be saved by default in a non-managed app on a DoD iOS device.  If the device is wiped via an MDM Enterprise remote wipe command, data saved in non-managed apps will not be deleted and may be accessible to unauthorized people that have access to the MDM-wiped device. If the device is wiped via a Full Device MDM remote wipe command, all data on the device, including managed and unmanaged, will be deleted, but a Full Device wipe may not be appropriate for devices that have been authorized for personal use and have personal data stored on them or are BYOD devices.  The risk in not using a Full Device wipe can be mitigated if a Managed Domain Configuration profile is installed on all managed iOS devices that contains a list of all DoD web domains that may have sensitive DoD data (CUI/FOUO) and PII data (primarily DoD web domains that require DoD PKI authentication credentials to access the web site).\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #9, 19, 28, 45g",
