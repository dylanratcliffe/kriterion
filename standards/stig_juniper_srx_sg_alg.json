      "title": "For User Role Firewalls, the Juniper SRX Services Gateway Firewall must employ user attribute-based security policies to enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources.",
      "description": "Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.\n\nThe Juniper Technical Library, Understanding User Role Firewalls, explains this Juniper SRX functionality in detail. This function integrates user-based firewall policies. Administrators can permit or restrict network access of employees, contractors, partners, and other users based on the roles they are assigned. User role firewalls enable greater threat mitigation, provide more informative forensic resources, improve record archiving for regulatory compliance, and enhance routine access provisioning. User role firewalls are more feasible with sites that do not have production workload and are used for employees to access network resources as opposed to large-scale datacenter environments.\n\nUser role firewalls trigger two actions, retrieval of user and/or role information associated with the traffic, and determine the action to take based on six match criteria within the context of the zone pair.\n\nThe source-identity field distinguishes a user role firewall from other types of firewalls. If the source identity is specified in any policy for a particular zone pair, it is a user role firewall. The user and role information must be retrieved before policy lookup occurs. If the source identity is not specified in any policy, user and role lookup is not required.\n\nTo retrieve user and role information, authentication tables are searched for an entry with an IP address corresponding to the traffic. If an entry is found, the user is classified as an authenticated user. If not found, the user is classified as an unauthenticated user.\n\nThe username and roles associated with an authenticated user are retrieved for policy matching. Both the authentication classification and the retrieved user and role information are used to match the source-identity field.\n\nCharacteristics of the traffic are matched to the policy specifications. Within the zone context, the first policy that matches the user or role and the five standard match criteria determines the action to be applied to the traffic.\"",

Logging for Firewall security-related sources such as screens and security policies must be configured separately. To ensure firewall filters, security screens and security policies send events to a Syslog server and local logs, security logging must be configured one each firewall term.",

      "description": "Without the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the audit records, identification, troubleshooting, and correlation of suspicious behavior would be difficult and could lead to a delayed or incomplete analysis of an ongoing attack.\n\nThe DoD requires centralized management of all network component audit record content. Network components requiring centralized audit log management must have the capability to support centralized management. The content captured in audit records must be managed from a central location (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Ensure at least one Syslog server and local files are configured to support requirements. However, the Syslog itself must also be configured to filter event records so it is not overwhelmed. A best practice when configuring the external Syslog server is to add similar log-prefixes to the log file names to help and researching of central Syslog server. Another best practice is to add a match condition to limit the recorded events to those containing the regular expression (REGEX). This requirement does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).\n\nWhile the Juniper SRX inherently has the capability to generate log records, by default only the high facility levels are captured and only to local files.",

      "title": "In the event that communications with the Syslog server is lost, the Juniper SRX Services Gateway must continue to queue traffic log records locally.",
      "description": "It is critical that when the network element is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required, it take action to mitigate the failure. Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.\n\nSince availability is an overriding concern given the role of the Juniper SRX in the enterprise, the system must not be configured to shut down in the event of a log processing failure. The system will be configured to log events to local files which will provide a log backup. If communication with the syslog server is lost or the server fails, the network device must continue to queue log records locally. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local log data with the collection server.\n\nBy default, both traffic log and system log events are sent to a local log file named messages. You can create a separate log file that contains only traffic log messages so that you do not need to filter for traffic log messages. This makes it easier to track usage patterns or troubleshoot issues for a specific policy. \n\nA best practice is to add log-prefixes to the log file names to help in researching the events and filters to prevent log overload. Another best practice is to add a match condition to limit the recorded events to those containing the regular expression (REGEX).",

The organization must determine which functions and services are required to perform the content filtering and other necessary core functionality for each component of the SRX. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured.

For example, the Juniper SRX can have an Antivirus, Web filter, IDS, or ALG license. However, if these functions are not part of the documented role of the SRX in the enterprise or branch architecture, then these the software and licenses should not be installed on the device. This mitigates the risk of exploitation of unconfigured services or services that are not kept updated with security fixes.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\n\nThis control does not imply that the device terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session.\n\nSince many of the inactivity timeouts pre-defined by Junos OS are set to 1800 seconds, an explicit custom setting of 900 must be set for each application used by the DoD implementation.
