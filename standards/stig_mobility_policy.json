  "description": "This STIG provides policy, training, and operating procedure security controls for the use of mobile/wireless devices and systems in the DoD environment. This STIG applies to any mobile/wireless device (such as WLAN Access Points and clients, Bluetooth devices, smartphones and cell phones, tablets, wireless keyboards and mice, and wireless remote access devices) used to store, process, transmit or receive DoD information.  The previous version of this STIG was called the General Wireless Policy STIG (V1R9).  Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via e-mail to the following address: disa.letterkenny.FSO.mbx.stig-customer-support-mailbox@mail.mil.",

Once policies are established, users must be trained to these requirements or the risk to the network remains.\n\nUser agreements are particularly important for mobile and remote users since there is a high risk of loss, theft, or compromise. Thus, this signed agreement is a good best practice to help ensure the site is confirming the user is aware of the risks and proper procedures. \n",

Although the system administrator may disable these embedded NICs, the user may purposefully or accidentally enable the device. These devices may also inadvertently transmit ambient sound or electronic signals. Therefore, simply disabling the transmit capability is an inadequate solution for computers processing classified information. In addition, embedded wireless cards do not meet DoD security requirements for classified wireless usage.",

Security is particularly important for wireless technologies attached to the enclave network because these systems increase the potential for eavesdropping and other unauthorized access to network resources.",
