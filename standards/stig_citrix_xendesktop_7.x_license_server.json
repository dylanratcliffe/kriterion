      "title": "XenDesktop License Server must implement DoD-approved encryption to protect the confidentiality of remote access sessions.",
      "description": "Without confidentiality protection mechanisms, unauthorized individuals may gain access to sensitive information via a remote access session. \n\nRemote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. \n\nEncryption provides a means to secure the remote connection to prevent unauthorized access to the data traversing the remote access connection, thereby providing a degree of confidentiality. The encryption strength of the mechanism is selected based on the security categorization of the information.",

      "description": "Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one. \n\nThe list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.",

      "title": "XenDesktop License Server must protect the authenticity of communications sessions.",
      "description": "Authenticity protection provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.\n\nApplication communication sessions are protected using transport encryption protocols, such as SSL or TLS. SSL/TLS provide web applications with a way to authenticate user sessions and encrypt application traffic. Session authentication can be single (one-way) or mutual (two-way) in nature. Single authentication authenticates the server for the client, whereas mutual authentication provides a means for both the client and the server to authenticate each other. \n\nThis requirement applies to applications that use communications sessions. This includes but is not limited to web-based applications and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). \n\nThis requirement addresses communications protection at the application session, versus the network packet, and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted. Depending on the required degree of confidentiality and integrity, web services/SOA will require the use of SSL/TLS mutual authentication (two-way/bidirectional).",

      "description": "Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised since unprotected communications can be intercepted and read or altered. \n\nThis requirement applies only to applications that are distributed or can allow access to data non-locally. Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPsec.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.",

      "title": "XenDesktop License Server must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and/or detect changes to information during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical safeguards, such as, at a minimum, a Protected Distribution Systems (PDS).",
      "description": "Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions that have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. \n\nThis requirement applies only to applications that are distributed or can allow access to data non-locally. Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPsec.\n\nAlternative physical protection measures include PDS. PDSs are used to transmit unencrypted classified National Security Information (NSI) through an area of lesser classification or control. Since the classified NSI is unencrypted, the PDS must provide adequate electrical, electromagnetic, and physical safeguards to deter exploitation.",
