      "description": "Different applications have unique requirements and toleration levels for delay, jitter, packet loss, and availability. To manage the multitude of applications and services, a network requires a Quality of Service (QoS) framework to differentiate traffic and provide a method to manage network congestion. The Differentiated Services Model (DiffServ) is based on per-hop behavior by categorizing traffic into different classes and enabling each node to enforce a forwarding treatment to each packet as dictated by a service policy. Packet markings such as IP Precedence and its successor, Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP), were defined along with specific per-hop behaviors for key traffic types to enable a scalable QoS solution. DiffServ QoS categorizes network traffic, prioritizes it according to its relative importance, and provides priority treatment based on the classification. It is imperative that end-to-end QoS is implemented to guarantee the required bandwidth for control plane traffic and C2 real-time services during periods of congestion within the JIE WAN IP network.",

PIM operates independent of any particular IP routing protocol but makes use of the IP unicast routing table--PIM does not keep a separate multicast routing table. The multicast tree is built by first allowing a flood of traffic from the source to every dense mode router in the network. For a brief time, unnecessary traffic is allowed. As each router receives traffic for the group, it will decide whether it has active recipients wanting to receive the multicast data. If so, the router will let the flow continue. If no hosts have registered for the multicast group, the router sends a prune message to its neighbor toward the source. That branch of the tree is then pruned off so that the unnecessary traffic does not continue. Dense mode is viewed as a \"flood and prune\" implementation. With PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), the multicast tree is not extended to a router unless a local host has already joined the group. The multicast tree is built by beginning with group members at the end leaf nodes and extending back toward a central root point--the tree is built from the bottom up. In either case, if an interface is not going to be supporting any of the multicast traffic--that is, join a multicast tree, PIM should be disabled.",

However, if the statically defined RP router becomes unreachable, there is no automatic failover to another RP router. Auto-RP distributes information to routers as to which RP address must be used for various multicast groups. Auto-RP eliminates inconsistencies and enables scalability and automatic failover. All PIM-enabled routers join the RP discovery group (224.0.1.40), which allows them to receive all group-to-RP mapping information. This information is distributed by an entity called RP mapping agent. Mapping agents themselves join the RP announce group (224.0.1.39). All candidate RPs advertise themselves periodically using the RP announce group address. The mapping agent listens to all RP candidate announcements and determines which routers will be used for each multicast group. It then advertises the RP and its associate multicast groups to all PIM routers in the network using an RP discovery message. Auto-RP announcement and discovery messages provide information (i.e., IP addresses of the RP candidates, multicast groups, etc.) vital to the multicast domain and should not be leaked out of the multicast domain.
