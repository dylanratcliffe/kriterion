      "description": "Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network. The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data.\n\nInformation flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but being transported to an unapproved destination.\n\nApplication Layer Gateways (ALGs) enforce approved authorizations by employing security policy and/or rules that restrict information system services, provide packet filtering capability based on header or protocol information and/or message filtering capability based on data content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).",

      "description": "Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks. Blocking or restricting detected harmful or suspicious communications between interconnected networks enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of traffic.\n\nThis requirement applies to the flow of information between the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) when used as a gateway or boundary device which allows traffic flow between interconnected networks of differing security policies.\n\nThe ALG installed and configured in such a way that restricts or blocks information flows based on guidance in the Ports, Protocols, & Services (PPSM) regarding restrictions for boundary crossing for ports, protocols, and services. Information flow restrictions may be implemented based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.\n\nThe ALGs must be configured with policy filters (e.g., security policy, rules, and/or signatures) that restrict or block information system services; provide a packet filtering capability based on header information; and/or perform message filtering based on message content. The policy filters used depend upon the type of application gateway (e.g., web, email, or TLS).",

      "description": "Without establishing what type of event occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.\n\nAudit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.\n\nAssociating event types with detected events in the gateway logs provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured network element.\n\nThis requirement does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).",

      "description": "Unrestricted traffic may contain malicious traffic that poses a threat to an enclave or to other connected networks. Additionally, unrestricted traffic may transit a network, which uses bandwidth and other resources.\n\nAccess control policies and access control lists implemented on devices that control the flow of network traffic (e.g., application-level firewalls and Web content filters) ensure the flow of traffic is only allowed from authorized sources to authorized destinations. Networks with different levels of trust (e.g., the Internet or CDS) must be kept separate.",

      "description": "A common vulnerability of network elements is unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This requirement guards against adverse or unintended system behavior caused by invalid inputs where information system responses to the invalid input may be disruptive or cause the system to fail into an unsafe state.\n\nThe behavior will be derived from the organizational and system requirements and includes, but is not limited to, notification of the appropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input.\n\nThis requirement applies to gateways and firewalls that perform content inspection or have higher layer proxy functions.",
