      "description": "Apple's Family Sharing service allows Apple iOS users to create a Family Group whose members have several shared capabilities, including the ability to lock, wipe, play a sound on, or locate the Apple iOS devices of other members. Each member of the group must be invited to the group and accept that invitation. A DoD user's Apple iOS device may be inadvertently or maliciously wiped by another member of the Family Group. This poses a risk that the user could be without a mobile device for a period of time or lose sensitive information that has not been backed up to other storage media. Configuring Apple iOS devices so their associated Apple IDs are not members of Family Groups mitigates this risk.\n\nNote: If the site uses Apple's optional Device Enrollment Program (DEP), this control is available as a supervised MDM control.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #47",

An adversary could use this information to target the user or to gather intelligence on the user's likely activities.
