Examples include, but are not limited to using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as, multiple servers.\n\nRationale for non-applicability: For the purposes of this SRG, a mobile operating system is assumed to support a single human-accessible user account.",

      "description": "Users are often the first line of defense within an application. Active users take notice of system and data conditions and are usually the first to notify systems administrators when they notice a system or application related anomaly pertaining to their own account. Inactive user accounts pose a risk to systems and applications. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. \n\nRationale for non-applicability: For the purposes of this SRG, a mobile operating system is assumed to support a single human-accessible user account.",

      "title": "The operating system must support the requirement to automatically audit on account creation.",
      "description": "Auditing of account creation is a method and best practice for mitigating the risk of an attacker creating a persistent method of re-establishing access. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail which documents the creation of accounts and if required notifies administrators. Such a process greatly reduces the risk of accounts being created outside the normal approval process and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes. Additionally, the audit records of account creation can be compared to the known approved account creation list.\n\nRationale for non-applicability: For the purposes of this SRG, a mobile operating system is assumed to support a single human-accessible user account.",

The operating system needs to be able to dynamically manage user privileges and access authorization decisions.\n\nRationale for non-applicability: For the purposes of this SRG, a mobile operating system is assumed to support a single human-accessible user account.",

An organization may determine certain commands or configuration changes require dual-authorization before being activated. The operating system must have the ability to enforce this dual authorization.\n\nRationale for non-applicability: For the purposes of this SRG, a mobile operating system is assumed to support a single human-accessible user account.",

      "description": "The trusted computing base includes the OS, device drivers, system and security configuration files, and key material. OS functions include audit and security policy enforcement mechanisms. In the context of this requirement, an update process is protected if is not modifiable by other processes and requires cryptographic authentication before performing updates. When access control to trusted computing base components is discretionary, a malicious user or program who obtains the necessarily privileges can circumvent security controls on the device. This likely enables the malicious user or process to obtain sensitive data and launch attacks on other systems. Privilege elevation on discretionary access control (DAC) systems can occur in a variety of ways that cannot be detected by the operating system or intrusion detection software. MAC systems preclude the possibility of this sort of privilege elevation by design and therefore greatly reduce the risk of system security breaches.",

      "description": "System integrity is dependent on properly controlling what software is executable. When programs are permitted to create or modify files and then subsequently execute those same files, this enables these programs to circumvent controls on the system designed to prevent malicious code execution. A rogue application that has the ability to both write and execute a file can perform a variety of unauthorized actions that could not have been anticipated when the application was authorized for installation. Such actions might include the ability to exfiltrate sensitive data on the device and to perform attacks on other systems. Preventing this behavior through the implementation of an appropriate MAC policy greatly mitigates the risk of this attack.",

      "description": "When an application has the ability to access the data and code of another application, it may use that access improperly to obtain sensitive DoD data or perform unauthorized functions, including attacks on the mobile device and possibly remote systems as well. Most malware depends on this type of unauthorized access to carry out its malicious objectives. MAC-based application sandboxing or isolation greatly reduces the ability of malware to compromise system security.",

Organizations may define specific security relevant information requiring protection.\n\nRationale for non-applicability: Resource constraints on mobile devices preclude implementation of this IA function. The applicability of this control may be reconsidered at a future date if subsequent generations of mobile devices are better able to support this control and the applications and data typically on the device justify its implementation.",

An example of a non-remote communications path from a remote device is a virtual private network (VPN).

Split-tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information system as an extension of the system and to communicate with local resources, such as a printer or file server. Since the remote device, when connected by a non-remote connection, becomes an extension of the information system allowing dual communications paths, such as split-tunneling, in effect allowing unauthorized external connections into the system. This is a split-tunneling requirement that can be controlled via the operating system by disabling interfaces.\n\nRationale for non-applicability: The use of commercial mobile devices as personal hotspots to connect to DoD networks is a critical user functionality.
