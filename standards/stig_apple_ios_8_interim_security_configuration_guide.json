The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #01",

      "description": "Apple Pay is a mobile payment technology that enables users to make purchases with their iOS devices, provided that the vendor supports the required Near Field Communications (NFC) interface to Apple Pay. If the payment system is vulnerable to breach, a user's charge cards may be used for unauthorized payments, including charges to government-issued cards. Disabling or avoiding use of Apple Pay mitigates this risk.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42",
