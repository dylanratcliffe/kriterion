Employing a separation of duties model reduces the threat that one individual has the authority to make changes to a system, and the authority to delete any record of those changes. \nThis requirement is intended to limit exposure due to operating from within a privileged account or role.  The inclusion of a role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. \nIt is recommended that the following or similar roles be supported:  \n- MDM administrative account administrator:  responsible for server installation, initial configuration, and maintenance functions.\n- Security configuration policy administrator (IA technical professional):  responsible for security configuration of the server and setting up and maintenance of mobile device security policies.\n- Device management administrator (Technical operator):  responsible for maintenance of mobile device accounts, including setup, change of account configurations, and account deletion.\n- Auditor (internal auditor or reviewer):  responsible for reviewing and maintaining server and mobile device audit logs.",
