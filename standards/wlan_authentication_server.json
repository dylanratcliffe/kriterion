      "description": "DoD CAC authentication is strong, two-factor authentication that relies on on carefully evaluated cryptographic modules.  Implementations of EAP-TLS that are not integrated with DoD CAC could have security vulnerabilities.  For example, an implementation that uses a client certificate on latop without a second factor could enable an adversary with access to the laptop to connect to the WLAN without a PIN or password.  Systems that do not use the DoD CAC are also much more likely to be vulnerable to weaknesses in the underlying public key infrastructure (PKI) that supports EAP-TLS.",

      "description": "EAP-TLS provides strong cryptographic mutual authentication and key distribution services not found in other EAP methods, and thus provides significantly more protection against attacks than other methods. Additionally, EAP-TLS supports two-factor user authentication on the WLAN client, which provides significantly more protection than methods that rely on a password or certificate alone. EAP-TLS also can leverage DoD CAC in its authentication services, providing additional security and convenience.",
