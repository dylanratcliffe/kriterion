High-value IT resources are the most important and critical IT resources within an organization. They contain the most sensitive data in an organization, perform the most critical tasks of an organization, or have access to and can control all or nearly all IT resources within an organization. Requiring a PAW used exclusively for remote administrative management of designated high-value IT resources, including servers, workstations, directory services, applications, databases, and network components, will provide a separate \"channel\" for the performance of administrative tasks on high-value IT resources and isolate these functions from the majority of threats and attack vectors found on higher-risk standard client systems. A main security architectural construct of a PAW is to remove non-administrative applications and functions from the PAW. Technical controls for securing high-value IT resources will be ineffective if administrators are not aware of key security requirements.",

The list must include the following IT resources:\n\n- Directory service (including Active Directory)\n- Cloud service\n- Identity management service\n- Privileged access management service\n- Credential management service\n- Security management service (anti-virus, network monitoring/scanning, IDS/IPS, etc.)\n- Any sensitive business/mission service\n- Any other IT resource designated as high value by the AO\n\nNote: A high-value IT resource is defined as any IT resource whose purpose is considered critical to the organization or whose loss or compromise would cause a significant impact on the organization.\n\nNote: Sensitive business/mission service is any business or mission service that needs additional protection from higher-risk IT services based on the nature of the function it provides; sensitivity of the data it consumes, processes, or stores; or criticality to the operation of the organization.\n\nHigh-value IT resources are the most important and critical IT resources within an organization. They contain the most sensitive data in an organization, perform the most critical tasks of an organization, or have access to and can control all or nearly all IT resources within an organization. Administrator accounts for high-value IT resources must be protected against various threats and attacks because threats to sensitive privileged accounts are high and risk of compromise is increasing. Requiring a PAW used exclusively for remote administrative management of designated high-value IT resources, including servers, workstations, directory services, applications, databases, and network components, will provide a separate \"channel\" for the performance of administrative tasks on high-value IT resources and isolate these functions from the majority of threats and attack vectors found on higher-risk standard client systems.\n\nSome IT resources, by the nature of the function they perform, should always be considered high value and should be remotely administered only via a PAW. The IT resources listed above are in this category.\n\nNote: The term \"manage\" in the Requirement statement includes any remote connection to a high-value IT resource (for example, to view resource status and current configuration or to make changes to any resource configuration).",
