      "description": "Logging must be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident. Remote access by administrators requires that the admin activity be logged. Application servers provide a web and command line-based remote management capability for managing the application server. Application servers must ensure that all actions related to administrative functionality such as application server configuration are logged.",

      "description": "To assure accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application server users must be uniquely identified and authenticated. This is typically accomplished via the use of a user store which is either local (OS-based) or centralized (LDAP) in nature. To ensure support to the enterprise, the authentication must utilize an enterprise solution.",

      "description": "Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords during transmission. Application servers have the capability to utilize LDAP directories for authentication. If LDAP connections are not protected during transmission, sensitive authentication credentials can be stolen. When the application server utilizes LDAP, the LDAP traffic must be encrypted.",

      "title": "vIDM must be configured to provide clustering.",
      "description": "This requirement is dependent upon system MAC and confidentiality. If the system MAC and confidentiality levels do not specify redundancy requirements, this requirement is NA. Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system. When application failure is encountered, preserving application state facilitates application restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes. Clustering of multiple application servers is a common approach to providing fail-safe application availability when system MAC and confidentiality levels require redundancy.",

      "description": "The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team. Any application providing too much information in error logs and in administrative messages to the screen risks compromising the data and security of the application and system. The extent to which the application server is able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Adequate logging levels and system performance capabilities need to be balanced with data protection requirements. The structure and content of error messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization and development team. Application servers must have the capability to log at various levels, which can provide log entries for potential security-related error events. An example is the capability for the application server to assign a criticality level to a failed logon attempt error message, a security-related error message being of a higher criticality.",

      "description": "A MAC I system is a system that handles data vital to the organization's operational readiness or effectiveness of deployed or contingency forces. A MAC I system must maintain the highest level of integrity and availability. By HA clustering the application server, the hosted application and data are given a platform that is load-balanced and provided high-availability.",

      "description": "Configuring the vRealize Automation application to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. \n\nThe vRA product is continually under refinement, and patches are regularly released to address vulnerabilities. As a result, the vRA STIG is also subject to a release cycle on a quarterly basis.\n\nAssessors should ensure that they are reviewing the vRealize Automation appliance with the most current STIG.",
