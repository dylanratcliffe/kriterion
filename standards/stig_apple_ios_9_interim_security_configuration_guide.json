Having a too-long timeout would increase the window of opportunity for adversaries who gain physical access to the mobile device through loss, theft, etc. Such devices are much more likely to be in an unlocked state when acquired by an adversary, thus granting immediate access to the data on the mobile device. The maximum timeout period of 15 minutes has been selected to balance functionality and security; shorter timeout periods may be appropriate depending on the risks posed to the mobile device.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #01b",

      "description": "Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and brute force attacks. The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #01a",

Setting a limit on the number of attempts mitigates this risk.

Passwords may also be a source of entropy for generation of key encryption or data encryption keys. If a password is not required to access data, then this data is accessible to any adversary who obtains physical possession of the device. Requiring that a password be successfully entered before the mobile device data is unencrypted mitigates this risk.\n\nNote: MDF PP v.2.0 requires a Password Authentication Factor and requires management of its length and complexity.
