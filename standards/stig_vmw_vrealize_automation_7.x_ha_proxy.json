Applications or systems that fail suddenly and with no incorporated failure state planning may leave the hosting system available but with a reduced security protection capability. Preserving information system state information also facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption of mission/business processes. An example is a firewall that blocks all traffic rather than allowing all traffic when a firewall component fails.
