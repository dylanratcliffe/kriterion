If the application does not provide the ability to centrally review the application logs, forensic analysis is negatively impacted.\n\nSegregation of logging data to multiple disparate computer systems is counterproductive and makes log analysis and log event alarming difficult to implement and manage, particularly when the system or application has multiple logging components written to different locations or systems.\n\nAutomated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, for example, Security Information Management products.",

Changes to information system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.\n\nDetecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the application. Examples of security responses include, but are not limited to the following: halting application processing; halting selected application functions; or issuing alerts/notifications to organizational personnel when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.",

Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThe organization must identify authorized software programs and permit execution of authorized software. The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.\n\nVerification of whitelisted software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.\n\nThis requirement applies to configuration management applications or similar types of applications designed to manage system processes and configurations (e.g., HBSS and software wrappers).",

Tanium supports the cryptographic signing and verification before execution of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. Enabling signing does away with the ability of an attacker to conduct Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks for the purposes of remote code execution and precludes the modification of the aforementioned data elements in transit. Additionally, Tanium supports object level signing for content ingested into the Tanium platform. This allows for the detection and rejection of changes to objects (sensors, actions, etc.) by even a privileged user within Tanium.\n\nTanium has built-in signing capabilities enabled by default when installed. Cryptographic signing and verification of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. before execution will be enforced by Tanium.\n\nSigning will prevent MitM remote code execution attacks and will protect data element in transit.
