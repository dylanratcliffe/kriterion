Limiting the number of allowed administrators and sessions per administrator is helpful in limiting risks related to DoS attacks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent sessions for administrative accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by a single administrator via multiple administrative accounts.

      "description": "A session lock is a temporary network device- or administrator-initiated action taken when the administrator stops work but does not log out of the network device. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their management session prior to vacating the vicinity, network devices need to be able to identify when a management session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock. Once invoked, the session lock shall remain in place until the administrator re-authenticates. No other system activity aside from re-authentication shall unlock the management session.\n\nNote that CCI-001133 requires that administrative network sessions be disconnected after 10 minutes of idle time.

Therefore, if account management functions are not automatically enforced, an attacker could gain privileged access to a vital element of the network security architecture.\n\nThis control does not include emergency administration accounts that provide access to the network device components in case of network failure. There must be only one such locally defined account.\n\nAll other accounts must be defined. All other accounts must be created and managed on the site's authentication server (e.g., RADIUS, LDAP, or Active Directory). This requirement is applicable to account management functions provided by the network device application. If the function is provided by the underlying OS or an authentication server, it must be secured using the applicable security guide or STIG.",

Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Network devices use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. \n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.
