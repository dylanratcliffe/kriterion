The difficulty with these commands is they use address-based authentication. An attacker who convinces a server that he is coming from a \"trusted\" machine can essentially get complete and unrestricted access to a system. The attacker can convince the server by impersonating a trusted machine and using IP address, by confusing DNS so that DNS thinks that the attacker's IP address maps to a trusted machine's name, or by any of a number of other methods.",

      "description": "Since NTP is used to ensure accurate log file time stamp information, NTP could pose a security risk if a malicious user were able to falsify NTP information. To launch an attack on the NTP infrastructure, a hacker could inject time that would be accepted by NTP clients by spoofing the IP address of a valid NTP server. To mitigate this risk, the time messages must be authenticated by the client before accepting them as a time source. \n\nTwo NTP-enabled devices can communicate in either client-server mode or peer-to-peer mode (aka \"symmetric mode\"). The peering mode is configured manually on the device and indicated in the outgoing NTP packets. The fundamental difference is the synchronization behavior: an NTP server can synchronize to a peer with better stratum, whereas it will never synchronize to its client regardless of the client's stratum. From a protocol perspective, NTP clients are no different from the NTP servers. The NTP client can synchronize to multiple NTP servers, select the best server and synchronize with it, or synchronize to the averaged value returned by the servers.\n\nA hierarchical model can be used to improve scalability. With this implementation, an NTP client can also become an NTP server providing time to downstream clients at a higher stratum level and of decreasing accuracy than that of its upstream server. To increase availability, NTP peering can be used between NTP servers. In the event the device loses connectivity to its upstream NTP server, it will be able to choose time from one of its peers. \n\nThe NTP authentication model is opposite of the typical client-server authentication model. NTP authentication enables an NTP client or peer to authenticate time received from their servers and peers. It is not used to authenticate NTP clients because NTP servers do not care about the authenticity of their clients, as they never accept any time from them.",

When uRPF is enabled on an interface, the router examines all packets received as input on that interface to make sure that the source address and source interface appear in the routing table and match the interface on which the packet was received.  If the packet was received from one of the best reverse path routes, the packet is forwarded as normal.  If there is no reverse path route on the same interface from which the packet was received, it might mean that the source address was modified.  If Unicast RPF does not find a reverse path for the packet, the packet is dropped.\n\nIf internal nodes automatically configure an address based on a prefix from a bogus Router Advertisement a dangerous situation may exist. An internal host may contact an internal server which responds with a packet that could be routed outside of the network via default routing (because the routers do not recognize the destination address as an internal address).  \n\nTo prevent this, filtering should be applied to network interfaces between internal host LANs and internal server LANs to insure that source addresses have valid prefixes. \n",

To control the vulnerability of this tunnel mechanism, it is critical to control the use of protocol 41 and use IPv4 filters to control what IPv4 nodes can send protocol 41 packets to an ISATAP router interface.

Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning categorizes network traffic, prioritizes it according to its relative importance, and provides priority treatment through congestion avoidance techniques. Implementing QoS within the network makes network performance more predictable and bandwidth utilization more effective. Most important, since the same bandwidth is being used to manage the network, it provides some assurance that there will be bandwidth available to troubleshoot outages and restore availability when needed. \n\nWhen management traffic must traverse several nodes to reach the management network, management traffic should be classified and marked at the nearest upstream MLS or router. In addition, all core routers within the managed network must be configured to provide preferred treatment based on the QoS markings. This will ensure that management traffic receives preferred treatment (per-hop behavior) at each forwarding device along the path to the management network. traffic.\n",
