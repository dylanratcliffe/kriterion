NSX Manager must be configured to automatically provide account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. All accounts used for access to the NSX components are privileged or system-level accounts. Therefore, if account management functions are not automatically enforced, an attacker could gain privileged access to a vital element of the network security architecture.\n\nWith the exception of the account of last resort, all accounts must be created and managed on the site's authentication server (e.g., RADIUS, LDAP, or Active Directory). This requirement is applicable to account management functions provided by the network device.",

      "description": "To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Network devices use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.",

In addition, access to audit records provides information an attacker could use to his or her advantage.\n \nTo ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the network device must protect audit information from any and all unauthorized read access. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods which will depend upon system architecture and design. Commonly employed methods for protecting audit information include least privilege permissions as well as restricting the location and number of log file repositories.\n \nAdditionally, network devices with user interfaces to audit records must not allow for the unfettered manipulation of or access to those records via the device interface. If the device provides access to the audit data, the device becomes accountable for ensuring audit information is protected from unauthorized access.",

Regularly backing up audit records to a different system or onto separate media than the system being audited helps to verify, in the event of a catastrophic system failure, the audit records will be retained. \n \nThis helps to verify a compromise of the information system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit records.",

Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long it takes to crack a password.\n \nThe shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. \n \nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level network connection.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever an administrator (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses a network device. Such administrator sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate network administrator access) without terminating network sessions. \n \nSession termination terminates all processes associated with an administrator's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the administrator (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. \n \nConditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

When administrators are assigned to the organizational roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every administrator (which can be a significant number of individuals for mid- to large-size organizations) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented either as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control.\n \nThe RBAC policies and the subjects and objects are defined uniquely for each network device, so they cannot be specified in the requirement.",

Auditing that is limited to conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting.

Organizations must consider setting time periods for different types of systems (e.g., financial, legal, or mission-critical systems). Organizations must also consider endpoints that may not have regular access to the authoritative time server (e.g., mobile, teleworking, and tactical endpoints). This requirement is related to the comparison done every 24 hours in CCI-001891 because a comparison must be done in order to determine the time difference.\n \nThe organization-defined time period will depend on multiple factors, most notably the granularity of time stamps in audit logs.

The network device must utilize an authoritative time server and/or be configured to use redundant authoritative time sources. This requirement is related to the comparison done in CCI-001891.\n \nDoD-approved solutions consist of a combination of a primary and secondary time source using a combination or multiple instances of the following: a time server designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet); United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers; and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).
