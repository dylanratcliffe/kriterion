This feature does not collect users' names, addresses, or any other identifying information except the IP address that is used to send the data. By default, users have the opportunity to opt into participation in the CEIP the first time they run an application. If an organization has policies that govern the use of external resources such as the CEIP, allowing users to opt in to the program might cause them to violate these policies.",
