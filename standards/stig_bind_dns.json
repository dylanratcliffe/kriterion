      "description": "DNS queries are normally conducted over UDP for performance reasons, although the protocol will fall back to TCP in certain cases. Unfortunately, the lack of a true bi-directional connection in UDP greatly simplifies certain attacks that involve forged packets.  While the connectionless UDP is in use, DNS servers will typically treat the first DNS response that matches certain characteristics of the outgoing query as the true response, and act upon the information provided.  The relevant characteristics for a valid or forged response are the query source port (usually an “ephemeral” port above 1024), the responding IP address, the DNS transaction ID, and the Question section of the outgoing query.  In the DNS protocol specification, none of these are required to have a great degree of randomness or unpredictability which makes certain attacks possible.  Eugene Kashpureff demonstrated a fairly simple but effective attack in 1997, which led to software improvements that included verification that information included in the response was in fact something for which the responding server should be trusted (referred to as “in bailiwick”).\n\nBecause this issue is fundamental to the DNS protocol over UDP, the IETF has devised the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and Transaction Authentication (TSIG) as protocol extensions to provide methods for cryptographic validation of data.  TSIG has been widely adopted and has been a DNS STIG requirement for several years, but DNSSEC has only recently become sufficiently mature and supported to be suitable for operational deployment.  Until DNSSEC is fully deployed, attacks on DNS-over-UDP, including cache poisoning attacks, will continue to be effective.\n",

      "description": "A potential vulnerability of DNS is that an attacker can poison a name servers cache by sending queries that will cause the server to obtain host-to-IP address mappings from bogus name servers that respond with incorrect information.   The DNS architecture needs to maintain one name server whose zone records are correct and the cache is not poisoned, in this effort the authoritative name server may not forward queries, one of the ways to prevent this, the root hints file is to be deleted.\nWhen authoritative servers are sent queries for zones that they are not authoritative for, and they are configured as a non-caching server (as recommended), they can either be configured to return a referral to the root servers or they can be configured to refuse to answer the query.  The requirement  is to configure authoritative servers to refuse to answer queries for any zones for which they are not authoritative.  This is more efficient for the server, and allows it to spend more of its resources doing what its intended purpose is; answering authoritatively for its zone.",
