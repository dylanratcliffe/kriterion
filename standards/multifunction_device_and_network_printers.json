Prevent unauthorized access to that information, including by repair or maintenance personnel.\nb. Ensure that repair procedures do not result in unauthorized dissemination of or access to classified information.\nc. Replace and destroy equipment parts in the appropriate manner when classified information cannot be removed.\nd. Ensure that appropriately knowledgeable, cleared personnel inspect equipment and associated media used to process classified information before the equipment is removed from protected areas to ensure there is no retained classified information.\ne.
