The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.

These messages should include a severity level indicator or code as an indicator of the criticality of the incident. These indicators reflect the occurrence of a compromise or a potential compromise. Since these incidents require immediate action, these messages are assigned a critical or level 1 priority/severity, depending on the system's priority schema.\n\nCJCSM 6510.01B, \"Cyber Incident Handling Program\", lists nine Cyber Incident and Reportable Event categories. DoD has determined that categories identified by CJCSM 6510.01B Major Indicators (category 1, 2, 4, or 7 detection events) will require an alert when an event is detected.\n\nAlerts may be transmitted, for example, telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging.
