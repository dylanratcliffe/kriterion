      "title": "Disabling of user name and password syntax from being used in URLs must be enforced.",
      "description": "The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard allows user authentication to be included in URL strings in the form http://username:password@example.com. A malicious user might use this URL syntax to create a hyperlink that appears to open a legitimate website but actually opens a deceptive (spoofed) website. For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax.\n\nThis functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If user names and passwords in URLs are allowed, users could be diverted to dangerous web pages, which would pose a security risk.",

      "description": "Internet Explorer performs a number of safety checks before initializing an ActiveX control. It will not initialize a control if the kill bit for the control is set in the registry, or if the security settings for the zone in which the control is located do not allow it to be initialized.\nThis functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). A security risk could occur if potentially dangerous controls are allowed to load.",

      "description": "Typically, when Internet Explorer loads a web page from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share that contains a Mark of the Web (MOTW) comment, indicating the page was saved from a site on the Internet, Internet Explorer runs the page in the Internet security zone instead of the less restrictive Local Intranet security zone. This functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a web page). If Internet Explorer does not evaluate the page for a MOTW, potentially dangerous code could be allowed to run.",

Disabling or not configuring this setting allows unknown websites to:\n-Create browser windows appearing to be from the local operating system.\n-Draw active windows displaying outside of the viewable areas of the screen capturing keyboard input.\n-Overlay parent windows with their own browser windows to hide important system information, choices, or prompts.",

Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow malicious code or users to become active on user computers or the network.

The Trust Bar contains a message informing users about the unsigned add-in.

User preferences may also allow the download to occur without prompting or interaction with the user.  Even if Internet Explorer prompts the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality.  Malicious websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file.

Web pages on a user's local computer have the fewest security restrictions and reside in the Local Machine zone, making this security zone a prime target for malicious users and code. Disabling or not configuring this setting could allow pages in the Internet zone to navigate to pages in the Local Machine zone to then run code to elevate privileges.

ActiveX controls do not run within a protected container in the browser like the other types of HTML or Microsoft Silverlight-based controls.
