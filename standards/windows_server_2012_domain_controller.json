      "description": "Executing application servers on the same host machine with a directory server may substantially weaken the security of the directory server.  Web or database server applications usually require the addition of many programs and accounts increasing the attack surface of the computer. \n\nSome applications require the addition of privileged accounts providing potential sources of compromise.  Some applications (such as MS Exchange) may require the use of network ports or services conflicting with the directory server.  In this case, non-standard ports might be selected and this could interfere with intrusion detection or prevention services.",
