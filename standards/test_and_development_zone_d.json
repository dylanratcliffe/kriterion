Network diagrams are important because they show the overall layout where devices are physically located within the network infrastructure. Diagrams also show the relationship and connectivity between devices where possible intrusive attacks could take place.  Having up-to-date network diagrams will also help show what the security, traffic, and physical impact of adding a system will be on the network.",

If the organization's assets are not registered with an asset management system, administrators will not be notified of important vulnerabilities such as viruses, denial of service attacks, system weaknesses, back doors, and other potentially harmful situations.

      "title": "Remote access VPNs must prohibit the use of split tunneling on VPN connections.",
      "description": "The VPN software on a host can be configured in either of two modes. It can be set to encrypt all IP traffic originating from that host, and send all of that traffic to the remote IP address of the network gateway. This configuration is called “tunnel-all” mode, because all IP traffic from the host must traverse the VPN tunnel to the remote system, where it will either be processed or further forwarded to additional IP addresses after decryption. Alternately, the VPN software can be set only to encrypt traffic that is specifically addressed to an IP at the other end of the VPN tunnel. All other IP traffic bypasses the VPN encryption and routing process, and is handled by the host as if the VPN relationship did not exist. This configuration is called “split-tunnel” mode, because the IP traffic from the host is split between encrypted packets sent across the VPN tunnel and unencrypted packets sent to all other external addresses. There are security and operational implications in the decision of whether to use split-tunnel or tunnel-all mode. Placing a host in tunnel-all mode makes it appear to the rest of the world as a node on the connected logical (VPN-connected) network. It no longer has an identity to the outside world based on the local physical network. In tunnel-all mode, all traffic between the remote host and any other host can be subject to inspection and processing by the security policy devices of the remote VPN-linked network. This improves the security aspects of the connected network, since it can enforce all security policies on the VPN-connected computer.",

Examples of this are a virtual machine located on government-furnished equipment used for operational tasks, or a separate physical machine sitting in a separate network segment or VLAN.

Bringing data directly from an untrusted network or downloaded from a personal computer or home Internet connection must be prohibited.  Scanning data is crucial to ensure the integrity of the information prior to deployment for T&D processes.  While not an all-inclusive list, data in this situation includes OS patches, application updates, operating systems, development tools, and test data.  In the T&D environment, there will typically be one or more IA-compliant systems accessing a secure Internet connection. If a secure Internet connection is not available, such as in Zone D, a connection in another zone can be used and the data moved by approved physical media into the zone.  Scanning the data with an anti-virus program will reduce the risk of exploits and of having vulnerable systems in the T&D environment taken over.  Downloading data from a single workstation for all zone environments is acceptable.  Organizations with NIPRNet connections must download all data through their NIPR connection for scanning at the IAPs.  Contractors or other DoD organizations without any direct NIPRNet connectivity will need to use a secure Internet connection following all applicable DoD IA policy and STIG requirements.  ",
