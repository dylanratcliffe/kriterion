  "description": "This STIG provides policy, training, and operating procedure security controls for the use of mobile devices (smartphone and tablets) that are not authorized to be connected to a DoD network or store or process sensitive or classified DoD data/information. Non-enterprise activated refers to any device that is operated under the use conditions found in Section 2.1 of the STIG overview document.

Once policies are established, users must be trained to these requirements or the risk to the network remains.\n\nUser agreements are particularly important for mobile and remote users since there is a high risk of loss, theft, or compromise. Thus, this signed agreement is a good best practice to help ensure the site is confirming the user is aware of the risks and proper procedures. \n",
