Once invoked, the session lock shall remain in place until the administrator re-authenticates. No other system activity aside from re-authentication shall unlock the management session.\n\nThe session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. This is typically at the operating system-level, but may be at the application-level. The session lock is initiated and controlled by either the client application or the workstation being used to access a network element.  Many terminal emulation clients implement this capability through software flow control or XOFF/XON flow control.\n\nIf this capability is not available, administrators must terminate all management sessions before leaving their management console or workstation.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Network devices use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. \n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.

Information flow control regulates where management information is allowed to travel within a network device. The flow of all management information must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network device or data. \n\nApplication-specific examples of enforcement occur in systems that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).\n\nApplications providing information flow control must be able to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of management information within the system in accordance with applicable policy.",

The device must prevent further activity until the administrator executes a positive action to manifest agreement.\n\nIn the case of CLI access using a terminal client, entering the username and password when the banner is presented is considered an explicit action of acknowledgement.

Auditing that is limited to conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near-real-time, within minutes, or within hours.\n\nThe individuals or roles to change the auditing are dependent on the security configuration of the network device--for example, it may be configured to allow only some administrators to change the auditing, while other administrators can review audit logs but not reconfigure auditing.

Products that are FIPS 140-2 validated will have an HMAC that meets specification; however, the option must be configured for use as the only message authentication code used for authentication to cryptographic modules.\n\nSeparate requirements for configuring applications and protocols used by each application (e.g., SNMPv3, SSHv2, NTP, HTTPS, and other protocols and applications that require server/client authentication) are required to implement this requirement. Where SSH is used, the SSHv2 protocol suite is required because it includes Layer 7 protocols such as SCP and SFTP, which can be used for secure file transfers. ",

For each network device, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or restricting the number of sessions the device opens at one time). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.\n\nThe security safeguards cannot be defined at the DoD level because they vary according to the capabilities of the individual network devices and the security controls applied on the adjacent networks (for example, firewalls performing packet filtering to block DoS attacks).",
