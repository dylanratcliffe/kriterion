Ensuring all web content directories have at least the equivalent of an index.html file is a significant factor to accomplish this end.\n\nEnumeration techniques, such as URL parameter manipulation, rely upon being able to obtain information about the web server's directory structure by locating directories without default pages. In the scenario, the web server will display to the user a listing of the files in the directory being accessed. By having a default hosted application web page, the anonymous web user will not obtain directory browsing information or an error message that reveals the server type and version.\n\nAs a web server, tc Server can be vulnerable to enumeration techniques if steps are not taken to mitigate the vulnerability. Ensuring that every document directory has an index.jsp (or equivalent) file is one common sense approach to mitigating the vulnerability.",
