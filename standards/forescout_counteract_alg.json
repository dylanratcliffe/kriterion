Authentication sessions between the authenticator and the application validating the user credentials must not be vulnerable to a replay attack.\n\nAn authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.\n\nA non-privileged account is any account with the authorizations of a non-privileged user. Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Security relevant roles include key management, account management, network and system administration, database administration, and web administration.\n\nTechniques used to address this include protocols using nonces (e.g., numbers generated for a specific one time use) or challenges (e.g., TLS).

      "description": "For remote access to non-privileged accounts, the purpose of requiring a device that is separate from the information system gaining access for one of the factors during multifactor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising authentication credentials stored on the system.\n\nMultifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD common access card.\n\nA privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.\n\nRemote access is access to DoD-nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.\n\nAn example of compliance with this requirement is the use of a one-time password token and PIN coupled with a password; or the use of a CAC/PIV card and PIN coupled with a password.",

The audit storage on the ALG is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the centralized log server designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred. However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real time which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.\n\nThis does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management).",

Audit processing failures include: software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses to audit failure depend upon the nature of the failure mode.\n\nWhen availability is an overriding concern, other approved actions in response to an audit failure are as follows: \n\n1. If the failure was caused by the lack of audit record storage capacity, the network element must continue generating audit records if possible (automatically restarting the audit service if necessary), overwriting the oldest audit records in a first-in-first-out manner.\n\n2. If audit records are sent to a centralized collection server and communication with this server is lost or the server fails, the network element must queue audit records locally until communication is restored or until the audit records are retrieved manually. Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server.\n\nA NAC is an essential security service and should not be shut down in the event of an audit failure. Redundancy and rollover features of the CounterACT enterprise or a high availability solution should be leveraged. Load balancing and redundancy is a function of the CounterAct enterprise architecture by default.",
