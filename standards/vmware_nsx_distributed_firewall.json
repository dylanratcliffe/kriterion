      "description": "Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n \nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n \nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary.",

      "description": "Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network. The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data.\n \nInformation flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems. Examples of information flow control restrictions include keeping export controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet or blocking information marked as classified but is being transported to an unapproved destination.\n \nALGs enforce approved authorizations by employing security policy and/or rules that restrict information system services, provide packet filtering capability based on header or protocol information and/or message filtering capability based on data content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).",

      "description": "Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks. Blocking or restricting detected harmful or suspicious communications between interconnected networks enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of traffic.\n \nThis requirement applies to the flow of information between the ALG when used as a gateway or boundary device which allows traffic flow between interconnected networks of differing security policies.\n \nThe ALG is installed and configured such that it restricts or blocks information flows based on guidance in the PPSM regarding restrictions for boundary crossing for ports, protocols and services. Information flow restrictions may be implemented based on attribute- and content-based inspection of the source, destination, headers, and/or content of the communications traffic.\n \nThe ALG must be configured with policy filters (e.g., security policy, rules, and/or signatures) that restrict or block information system services; provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information; and/or perform message-filtering based on message content. The policy filters used depends upon the type of application gateway (e.g., web, email, or TLS).",

      "title": "The NSX Distributed Firewall must not have unnecessary services and functions enabled.",
      "description": "Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions (capabilities or processes) and services. Some of these functions and services are installed and enabled by default. The organization must determine which functions and services are required to perform the content filtering and other necessary core functionality for each component of the ALG. These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.\n \nThe primary function of an ALG is to provide application specific content filtering and/or proxy services. The ALG application suite may integrate related content filtering and analysis services and tools (e.g., IPS, proxy, malware inspection, black/white lists). Some gateways may also include email scanning, decryption, caching, and DLP services. However, services and capabilities which are unrelated to this primary functionality must not be installed (e.g., DNS, email client or server, FTP server, or web server).\n \nNext Generation ALGs (NGFW) and Unified Threat Management (UTM) ALGs integrate functions which have been traditionally separated. These products integrate content filtering features to provide more granular policy filtering. There may be operational drawbacks to combining these services into one device. Another issue is that NGFW and UTM products vary greatly with no current definitive industry standard.",

      "title": "The NSX Distributed Firewall must be configured to prohibit or restrict the use of functions, ports, protocols, and/or services, as defined in the PPSM CAL and vulnerability assessments.",
      "description": "In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types); organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.\n \nALGs are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. DoD continually assesses the ports, protocols, and services that can be used for network communications. Some ports, protocols or services have known exploits or security weaknesses. Network traffic using these ports, protocols, and services must be prohibited or restricted in accordance with DoD policy. The ALG is a key network element for preventing these non-compliant ports, protocols, and services from causing harm to DoD information systems.\n \nThe network ALG must be configured to prevent or restrict the use of prohibited ports, protocols, and services throughout the network by filtering the network traffic and disallowing or redirecting traffic as necessary. Default and updated policy filters from the vendors will disallow older version of protocols and applications and will address most known non-secure ports, protocols, and/or services. However, sources for further policy filters are the IAVMs and the PPSM requirements.",

The allow policy filters must comply with the site's security policy. A deny all, permit by exception network communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and approved, are allowed.\n \nThis requirement applies to both inbound and outbound network communications traffic. All inbound and outbound traffic for which the ALG is acting as an intermediary or proxy must be denied by default.",

      "description": "Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\n \nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level, and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system level network connection.\n \nALGs may provide session control functionality as part of content filtering, load balancing, or proxy services.",

      "description": "A compromised host in an enclave can be used by a malicious actor as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third parties. This is a common practice in \"botnets\", which are a collection of compromised computers using malware to attack (usually DDoS) other computers or networks. DDoS attacks frequently leverage IP source address spoofing, in which packets with false source IP addresses send traffic to multiple hosts, which then send return traffic to the hosts with the IP addresses that were forged. This can generate significant, even massive, amounts of traffic. Therefore, protection measures to counteract IP source address spoofing must be taken.\n \nThe router must not accept any outbound IP packets that contain an illegitimate address in the source address field by enabling Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) strict mode or by implementing an egress ACL. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) provides an IP address spoof protection capability. When uRPF is enabled in strict mode, the packet must be received on the interface that the device would use to forward the return packet.",
