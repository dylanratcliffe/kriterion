      "description": "With any network service, there is the potential that an attacker can exploit a vulnerability within the program that allows the attacker to gain control of the process and even run system commands with that control. One possible defense against this attack is to limit the software to particular quarantined areas of the file system, memory or both. This effectively restricts the service so that it will not have access to the full file system. If such a defense were in place, then even if an attacker gained control of the process, the attacker would be unable to reach other commands or files on the system. This approach often is referred to as a padded cell, jail, or sandbox. All of these terms allude to the fact that the software is contained in an area where it cannot harm either itself or others. A more technical term is a chroot(ed) directory structure.\n\nBIND should be configured to run in a padded cell or chroot(ed) directory structure.",

However, it is recognized that security vulnerabilities in BIND are identified and then addressed on a regular, ongoing basis. Therefore it is required that the product be maintained at the latest stable versions in order to address vulnerabilities that are subsequently identified and can then be remediated via updates to the product.\n\nFailure to run a version of BIND that has the capability to implement all of the required security features and that does provide services compliant to the DNS RFCs can have a severe impact on the security posture of a DNS infrastructure. Without the required security in place, a DNS implementation is vulnerable to many types of attacks and could be used as a launching point for further attacks on the organizational network that is utilizing the DNS implementation.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000516-DNS-000097, SRG-APP-000516-DNS-000103",

      "description": "Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident, or identify those responsible for one. The actual auditing is performed by the OS/NDM, but the configuration to trigger the auditing is controlled by the DNS server.\n\nThe list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records. \n\nThe DoD has defined the list of events for which the application will provide an audit record generation capability as the following: \n\n(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);\n\n(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; and\n\n(iii) All account creation, modification, disabling, and termination actions.\n\nThe DoD has defined the data which the application will provide an audit record generation capability for an event as the following: \n\n(i) Establish the source of the event;\n\n(ii) The outcome of the event; and\n\n(iii) Identify the application itself as the source of the event.\n\nWithout establishing the source of the event, it is impossible to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Associating information about the source of the event within the application provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured application. \n\nWithout information about the outcome of events, security personnel cannot make an accurate assessment about whether an attack was successful or if changes were made to the security state of the system.\n\nEvent outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event occurred). As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response.\"\nFailure to a known state can address safety or security in accordance with the mission/business needs of the organization. Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system. Preserving application state information helps to facilitate application restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption to mission-essential processes.\n\nThe DNS server should be configured to generate audit records whenever a self-test fails. The OS/NDM is responsible for generating notification messages related to this audit record.\n\nIf authorized individuals do not have the ability to modify auditing parameters in response to a changing threat environment, the organization may not be able to effectively respond, and important forensic information may be lost.\n\nThis requirement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example, near real-time, within minutes, or within hours.\n\nIn addition to logging where events occur within the application, the application must also produce audit records that identify the application itself as the source of the event. In order to compile an accurate risk assessment and provide forensic analysis, it is essential for security personnel to know the source of the event, particularly in the case of centralized logging. In the case of centralized logging, the source would be the application name accompanied by the host or client name.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000089-DNS-000004, SRG-APP-000098-DNS-000009, SRG-APP-000099-DNS-000010, SRG-APP-000226-DNS-000032, SRG-APP-000275-DNS-000040, SRG-APP-000353-DNS-000045",

Once a name server has been poisoned, legitimate clients may be directed to non-existent hosts (which constitutes a denial of service), or, worse, hosts that masquerade as legitimate ones to obtain sensitive data or passwords. \n\nTo guard against poisoning, name servers authoritative for .mil domains should be separated functionally from name servers that resolve queries on behalf of internal clients. Organizations may achieve this separation by dedicating machines to each function or, if possible, by running two instances of the name server software on the same machine: one for the authoritative function and the other for the resolving function. In this design, each name server process may be bound to a different IP address or network interface to implement the required segregation.\n\nDNSSEC ensures that the answer received when querying for name resolution actually comes from a trusted name server. Since DNSSEC is still far from being globally deployed external to DoD, and many resolvers either have not been updated or do not support DNSSEC, maintaining cached zone data separate from authoritative zone data mitigates the gap until all DNS data is validated with DNSSEC. \n\nSince DNS forwarding of queries can be accomplished in some DNS applications without caching locally, DNS forwarding is the method to be used when providing external DNS resolution to internal clients.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000246-DNS-000035, SRG-APP-000383-DNS-000047",

      "description": "A mechanism to detect and prevent unauthorized communication flow must be configured or provided as part of the system design. If information flow is not enforced based on approved authorizations, the system may become compromised. Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a system and between interconnected systems. The flow of all application information must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the systems or data.\n\nWithin the context of DNS, this is applicable in terms of controlling the flow of DNS information between systems, such as DNS zone transfers.\n\nAuthoritative name servers (especially primary name servers) should be configured with an allow-transfer access control sub statement designating the list of hosts from which DNS information, such as zone transfers, can be accepted. These restrictions address the denial-of-service threat and potential exploits from unrestricted dissemination of information about internal resources.\n\nZone transfer from primary name servers should be restricted to secondary name servers. The zone transfer should be completely disabled in the secondary name servers. The address match list argument for the allow-transfer sub statement should consist of IP addresses of secondary name servers and stealth secondary name servers.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000215-DNS-000003, SRG-APP-000516-DNS-000095",

      "description": "The best way for a zone administrator to minimize the impact of a key compromise is by limiting the validity period of RRSIGs in the zone and in the parent zone. This strategy limits the time during which an attacker can take advantage of a compromised key to forge responses. An attacker that has compromised a ZSK can use that key only during the KSK's signature validity interval. An attacker that has compromised a KSK can use that key for only as long as the signature interval of the RRSIG covering the DS RR in the delegating parent.

It sends this special RR, along with its signatures, to the resolving name server.

If a slave server has been retired or is not operational but remains on the list, then an adversary might have a greater opportunity to impersonate that slave without detection, rather than if the slave were actually online.

The requirement is to configure authoritative servers to refuse to answer queries for any zones for which they are not authoritative. This is more efficient for the server, and allows it to spend more of its resources doing what its intended purpose is; answering authoritatively for its zone.",
