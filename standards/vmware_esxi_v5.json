Normally a new log file is created only when a host is rebooted, so the file can grow to be quite large. Ensure new log files are created more frequently by limiting the maximum size of the log files. To restrict the total size of logging data, VMware recommends saving 10 log files, each one limited to 1,000KB. Datastores are likely to be formatted with a block size of 2MB or 4MB, so a size limit too far below this size would result in unnecessary storage utilization. Each time an entry is written to the log, the size of the log is checked; if it is over the limit, the next entry is written to a new log. If the maximum number of log files already exists, when a new one is created, the oldest log file is deleted. A denial-of-service attack that avoids these limits might be attempted by writing an enormous log entry. But each log entry is limited to 4KB, so no log files are ever more than 4KB larger than the configured limit. A second option is to disable logging for the virtual machine. Disabling logging for a virtual machine makes troubleshooting challenging and support difficult. Do not consider disabling logging unless the log file rotation approach proves insufficient. Uncontrolled logging can lead to denial-of-service due to the datastore becoming filled.",

When a non-remote connection is established using a virtual private network, the configuration settings prevent split-tunneling. Split-tunneling might otherwise be used by remote users to communicate with the information system as an extension of the system and to communicate with local resources, such as a printer or file server. Since the remote device, when connected by a non-remote connection, becomes an extension of the information system allowing dual communications paths, such as split-tunneling, in effect allowing unauthorized external connections into the system. This is a split-tunneling requirement that can be controlled via the operating system by disabling interfaces. Applicable, but permanent not-a-finding - Host (ESXi Server) isolation on a separate, non-routed, management network is required.

      "description": "Security attributes are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects, objects) with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., records, buffers, files, registry keys) within the information system and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy. The term security label is often used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure for that object (e.g., user access privileges, nationality, affiliation as contractor). A security label is defined as the means used to associate a set of security attributes with a specific information object as part of the data structure for the object. Security attributes need to be displayed in human readable form in order to determine how the data should be disseminated, handled, and what distribution instructions apply to the data. When applications generate or output data, the associated security attributes need to be displayed.
