Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.\n\nFor devices with severe character limitations, the banner text is: \n\nI've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't.\n\nThe administrator must configure the banner text exactly as written without any changes.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1 #36",
