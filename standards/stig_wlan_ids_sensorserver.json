      "description": "Unauthorized WLAN devices threaten DoD networks in a variety of ways.  If someone installs an access point on a DoD network, then people may use that access point to access network resources without any perimeter security controls, which significantly degrades the IA posture of that network.  If someone installs an unauthorized access point in the site’s vicinity, even if not connected to a DoD network, then site users may unknowingly or inadvertently connect to it.  Once this connection occurs, the user’s traffic may be diverted to spoofed web sites and other servers to capture the user’s authentication credentials and sensitive DoD data.  Finally, if an unauthorized WLAN client is operating inside or near the site, it may improperly connect to the site’s WLAN infrastructure or other network devices that improperly have left open active Wi-Fi interfaces.   WIDS can help counter all of these threats. ",
