Once policies are established, users must be trained to these requirements or the risk to the network remains.\n\nUser agreements are particularly important for mobile and remote users since there is a high risk of loss, theft, or compromise. Thus, this signed agreement is a good best practice to help ensure the site is confirming the user is aware of the risks and proper procedures. \n",
