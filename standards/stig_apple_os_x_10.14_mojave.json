Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.\n\nThis requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g., VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the purpose of configuring the device itself (management).\n\nRequires further clarification from NIST.",
