      "description": "To assure accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application server users must be uniquely identified and authenticated.  This is typically accomplished via the use of a user store that is either local (OS-based) or centralized (LDAP) in nature.\n\nTo ensure support to the enterprise, the authentication must utilize an enterprise solution.",

      "title": "The vRealize Operations server session timeout must be configured.",
      "description": "If communications sessions remain open for extended periods of time even when unused, there is the potential for an adversary to hijack the session and use it to gain access to the device or networks to which it is attached. Terminating sessions after a logout event or after a certain period of inactivity is a method for mitigating the risk of this vulnerability. When a user management session becomes idle, or when a user logs out of the management interface, the application server must terminate the session.",

      "description": "Failure to a known secure state helps prevent a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability in the event of a failure of the information system or a component of the system.\n\nWhen an application is deployed to the application server, if the deployment process does not complete properly and without errors, there is the potential that some application files may not be deployed or may be corrupted and an application error may occur during runtime.\n\nThe application server must be able to perform complete application deployments. A partial deployment can leave the server in an inconsistent state. Application servers may provide a transaction rollback function to address this issue.",

      "description": "Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DoD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.\n\nThe DoD will only accept PKI certificates obtained from a DoD-approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of SSL/TLS certificates.  The application server must only allow the use of DoD PKI-established certificate authorities for verification.",

      "description": "Configuring the vRealize Operations appliance to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements. \n\nThe vROps product is continually under refinement, and patches are regularly released to address vulnerabilities. As a result, the vROps STIG is also subject to a release cycle on a quarterly basis.\n\nAssessors should ensure that they are reviewing the vRealize Operations appliance with the most current STIG.",
