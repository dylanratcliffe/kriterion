      "description": "Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection. Without identifying devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity. Without authenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity.\n\nRemote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.\n\nCryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.\n\nFor distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of identification claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide the identification decisions (as opposed to the actual identifiers) to the services that need to act on those decisions.\n\nFor distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of authentication claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. In such situations, it is necessary to provide authentication decisions (as opposed to the actual authenticators) to the services that need to act on those decisions.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications that connect locally, remotely, or through a network to an endpoint device (including but not limited to workstations, printers, servers [outside a datacenter], VoIP Phones, and VTC CODECs). Gateways and SOA applications are examples of where this requirement would apply.\n\nDevice authentication is a solution enabling an organization to manage devices. It is an additional layer of authentication ensuring only specific preauthorized devices can access the system.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000015, SRG-APP-000158, SRG-APP-000394",

      "description": "All of Tanium's signing capabilities should be enabled upon install. Tanium supports the cryptographic signing and verification before execution of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. Enabling signing does away with the ability of an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks for the purposes of remote code execution and precludes the modification of the aforementioned data elements in transit. Additionally, Tanium supports object-level signing for content ingested into the Tanium platform. This allows for the detection and rejection of changes to objects (sensors, actions, etc.) by even a privileged user within Tanium.\n\nTanium has built-in signing capabilities enabled by default when installed. Cryptographic signing and verification of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. before execution will be enforced by Tanium.\n\nAuthenticity protection provides protection against MitM attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.\n\nApplication communication sessions are protected using transport encryption protocols, such as SSL or TLS. SSL/TLS provides web applications with a way to authenticate user sessions and encrypt application traffic. Session authentication can be single (one-way) or mutual (two-way) in nature. Single authentication authenticates the server for the client, whereas mutual authentication provides a means for both the client and the server to authenticate each other.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications that use communications sessions. This includes but is not limited to web-based applications and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). \n\nThis requirement addresses communications protection at the application session, versus the network packet, and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted. Depending on the required degree of confidentiality and integrity, web services/SOA will require the use of SSL/TLS mutual authentication (two-way/bidirectional).\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000131, SRG-APP-000219",

The Tanium environment can perform hundreds or thousands of times faster than other security or systems management tools because the Tanium Clients communicate in secure, linearly-controlled peer-to-peer rings. Because clients dynamically communicate with other nearby agents based on proximity and latency, rings tend to form automatically to match a customer's topology--endpoints in California will form one ring while endpoints in Germany will form a separate ring.\n\nhttps://docs.tanium.com/platform_install/platform_install/reference_network_ports.html",

Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Applications restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.\n\nIf shared/group account credentials are not terminated when individuals leave the group, the user who left the group can still gain access even though they are no longer authorized.

      "description": "Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised since unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered. Without authenticating devices, unidentified or unknown devices may be introduced, thereby facilitating malicious activity. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\n\nThis requirement applies only to applications that are either distributed or can allow access to data non-locally. Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process. When transmitting data, applications need to leverage transmission protection mechanisms, such as TLS, SSL VPNs, or IPsec.\n\nCommunication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.\n\nAll of Tanium's signing capabilities should be enabled upon install. Tanium supports the cryptographic signing and verification before execution of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. Enabling signing does away with the ability of an attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks for the purposes of remote code execution and precludes the modification of the aforementioned data elements in transit. Additionally, Tanium supports object-level signing for content ingested into the Tanium platform. This allows for the detection and rejection of changes to objects (sensors, actions, etc.) by even a privileged user within Tanium.\n\nTanium has built-in signing capabilities enabled by default when installed. Cryptographic signing and verification of all Sensors, Questions, Actions, Sensor Libraries, File Shards, etc. before execution will be enforced by Tanium.\n\nAuthenticity protection provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.\n\nApplication communication sessions are protected using transport encryption protocols, such as SSL or TLS. SSL/TLS provides web applications with a way to authenticate user sessions and encrypt application traffic. Session authentication can be single (one-way) or mutual (two-way) in nature. Single authentication authenticates the server for the client, whereas mutual authentication provides a means for both the client and the server to authenticate each other.\n\nThis requirement applies to applications that use communications sessions. This includes but is not limited to web-based applications and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA).\n\nThis requirement addresses communications protection at the application session, versus the network packet, and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the validity of information transmitted. Depending on the required degree of confidentiality and integrity, web services/SOA will require the use of SSL/TLS mutual authentication (two-way/bidirectional).\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000439, SRG-APP-000395, SRG-APP-000441, SRG-APP-000131, SRG-APP-000219",
