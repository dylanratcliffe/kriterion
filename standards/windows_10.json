      "title": "Administrative accounts must not be used with applications that access the Internet, such as web browsers, or with potential Internet sources, such as email.",
      "description": "Using applications that access the Internet or have potential Internet sources using administrative privileges exposes a system to compromise. If a flaw in an application is exploited while running as a privileged user, the entire system could be compromised. Web browsers and email are common attack vectors for introducing malicious code and must not be run with an administrative account.\n\nSince administrative accounts may generally change or work around technical restrictions for running a web browser or other applications, it is essential that policy requires administrative accounts to not access the Internet or use applications, such as email.\n\nThe policy should define specific exceptions for local service administration. These exceptions may include HTTP(S)-based tools that are used for the administration of the local system, services, or attached devices.\n\nTechnical means such as application whitelisting can be used to enforce the policy to ensure compliance.",
