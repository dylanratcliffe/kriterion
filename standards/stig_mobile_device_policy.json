      "description": "With the increasing popularity of wireless networking, most laptops have wireless NICs (network interface cards) installed on the laptop motherboard. Although the system administrator may disable these embedded NICs, the user may purposefully or accidentally enable the device. These devices may also inadvertently transmit ambient sound or electronic signals. Therefore, simply disabling the transmit capability is an inadequate solution for computers processing classified information. In addition, embedded wireless cards do not meet DoD security requirements for classified wireless usage.",

After a data spill, the mobile device must either be wiped using approved procedures, or destroyed if no procedures are available, so classified or sensitive data is not exposed.
