      "description": "Organizations should deploy anti-virus software on all hosts for which satisfactory anti-virus software is available. Anti-virus software should be installed as soon after OS installation as possible and then updated with the latest signatures and anti-virus software patches (to eliminate any known vulnerabilities in the anti-virus software itself). To support the security of the host, the anti-virus software should be configured and maintained properly so it continues to be effective at detecting and stopping malware. Anti-virus software is most effective when its signatures are fully up-to-date. Accordingly, anti-virus software should be kept current with the latest signature and software updates to improve malware detection.",

Users should not be able to disable or delete anti-virus software from their hosts, nor should they be able to alter critical settings. Anti-virus administrators should perform continuous monitoring to confirm that hosts are using current anti-virus software and that the software is configured properly. Implementing all of these recommendations should strongly support an organization in having a strong and consistent anti-virus deployment across the organization.",

The evidence may be very recent (only a few minutes old) or not so recent (hours or days old); the older the information is, the less accurate it is likely to be. The most obvious sources of evidence are those that are designed to identify malware activity, such as anti-virus software, content filtering (e.g., anti-spam measures), IPS, and SIEM technologies. The logs of security applications might contain detailed records of suspicious activity, and might also indicate whether a security compromise occurred or was prevented. While logging is imperative to forensic analysis, logs could grow to the point of impacting disk space on the system. In order to avoid the risk of logs growing to the size of impacting the operating system, the log size and number of log files will be restricted, but must also be large enough to retain forensic value.",

      "description": "Due to the ability of malware to mutate after infection, standard anti-virus signatures may not be able to catch new strains or variants of the malware. Typically, these strains and variants will share unique characteristics with others in their virus family. By using a generic signature to detect the shared characteristics, using wildcards where differences lie, the generic signature can detect viruses even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code. This method of detection is Heuristic detection.",

      "description": "Anti-virus software vendors use collective intelligence from sensors and cross-vector intelligence from web, email, and network threats to compile scores that reflect the likelihood of whether a file in question is malware. The collective intelligence is constantly being updated, more frequently than the typical daily anti-virus signature files. With File Reputation lookup, a more real-time response to potential malicious code is realized than with the local-running anti-virus software, since by querying the cloud-based database when a file appears to be suspicious, up-to-the-minute intelligence is provided. This type of protection reduces the threat protection time period from days to milliseconds, increases malware detection rates, and reduces downtime and remediation costs associated with malware attacks. Using File Reputation lookup is mandated by US CYBERCOM on DoD systems.",

Recommended actions include analyzing any suspected malware incident and validating that malware is the cause. This includes identifying characteristics of the malware activity by examining detection sources, such as anti-virus software, intrusion prevention systems, and security information and event management (SIEM) technologies and identifying which hosts are infected by the malware, so the hosts can undergo the appropriate containment, eradication, and recovery actions. By sending all events to a central location, the events can be correlated to determine extent of infection.",
