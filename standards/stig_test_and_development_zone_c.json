Network diagrams are important because they show the overall layout where devices are physically located within the network infrastructure. Diagrams also show the relationship and connectivity between devices where possible intrusive attacks could take place.  Having up-to-date network diagrams will also help show what the security, traffic, and physical impact of adding a system will be on the network.",

If the organization's assets are not registered with an asset management system, administrators will not be notified of important vulnerabilities such as viruses, denial of service attacks, system weaknesses, back doors, and other potentially harmful situations.

If the information shared between interconnecting sites is marked for anything other than public release or is need to know, then it must use encryption correlating with the classification of the data in transit.

Bringing data directly from an untrusted network or downloaded from a personal computer or home Internet connection must be prohibited.  Scanning data is crucial to ensure the integrity of the information prior to deployment for T&D processes.  While not an all-inclusive list, data in this situation includes OS patches, application updates, operating systems, development tools, and test data.  In the T&D environment, there will typically be one or more IA-compliant systems accessing a secure Internet connection. If a secure Internet connection is not available, such as in Zone D, a connection in another zone can be used and the data moved by approved physical media into the zone.  Scanning the data with an anti-virus program will reduce the risk of exploits and of having vulnerable systems in the T&D environment taken over.  Downloading data from a single workstation for all zone environments is acceptable.  Organizations with NIPRNet connections must download all data through their NIPR connection for scanning at the IAPs.
