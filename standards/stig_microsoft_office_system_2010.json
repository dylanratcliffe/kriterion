If the control is not marked SFI, the application loads the control in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or uses the default (first-time initialization) settings.

If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer—or it's possible the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date.\nSFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode.
