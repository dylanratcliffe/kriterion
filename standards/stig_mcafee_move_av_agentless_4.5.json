The anti-virus software should then perform a complete scan of the host to identify any potential infections. To support the security of the host, the anti-virus software should be configured and maintained properly so it continues to be effective at detecting and stopping malware. Anti-virus software is most effective when its signatures are fully up to date. Accordingly, anti-virus software should be kept current with the latest signature and software updates to improve malware detection.",

This is the duration for which a McAfee MOVE AV Agent will wait for scan response of a file from the Security Virtual Machine (SVM). Typically, file scans are very fast. However, file scans may take longer due to large file size, file type, or heavy load on the SVM. If the file scan takes longer than the scan timeout limit, the file access is allowed and a scan timeout event is generated. Setting the timeout too low may result in scans of a file terminating before the scan is completed, resulting in malware potentially going undetected.",

The collective intelligence is constantly being updated, more frequently than the typical daily anti-virus signature files. \n\nWith File Reputation lookup, a more real-time response to potential malicious code is realized than with the local-running anti-virus software, since by querying the cloud-based database when a file appears to be suspicious, up-to-the-minute intelligence is provided. This type of protection reduces the threat protection time period from days to milliseconds, increases malware detection rates, and reduces downtime and remediation costs associated with malware attacks. Using File Reputation lookup is mandated by USCYBERCOM on DoD systems.",
