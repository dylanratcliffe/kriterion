      "description": "Use of unapproved devices to process non-publicly releasable data increases the risk to the network.  Devices attached to or inserted into the end point's plug-and-play ports and slots can be a vector for the insertion of malware when used to access the network.  Storage devices are portable and can be easily concealed. Devices with volatile memory (erased when not connected) may contain internal batteries that also pose a threat to attached systems.  Requiring approval prior to use of these devices heightens awareness of the threat, limits the potential use of contaminated devices, and allows for proper tracking and control. Designated Approval Authority (DAA) approval of flash memory devices is required by the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) Communications Task Order (CTO) 10-004A Removable Flash Media Device Implementation within and between Department of Defense (DoD) Networks (U/FOUO) (or latest version of this CTO).
