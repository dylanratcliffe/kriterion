Failure to configure an application whitelist properly could allow unauthorized and malicious applications to be downloaded, installed, and executed on the mobile device, causing a compromise of DoD data accessible by these applications. The actions of some enterprise apps cannot be controlled by whitelist, such as backup of application information to OneDrive. Other mitigation techniques will be required to facilitate those actions to safeguard data.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #10",

      "description": "The screen lock time-out must be set to a value that helps protect the device from unauthorized access. Having a too-long time-out would increase the window of opportunity for adversaries who gain physical access to the mobile device through loss, theft, etc. Such devices are much more likely to be in an unlocked state when acquired by an adversary, thus granting immediate access to the data on the mobile device. The maximum time-out period of 15 minutes has been selected to balance functionality and security; shorter time-out periods may be appropriate, depending on the risks posed to the mobile device.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #02",

      "description": "Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and brute-force attacks. The ability to crack a password is a function of how many attempts an adversary is permitted, how quickly an adversary can do each attempt, and the size of the password space. The longer the minimum length of the password is, the larger the password space. Having a too-short minimum password length significantly reduces password strength, increasing the chance of password compromise and resulting device and data compromise.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #01",

If data at rest is unencrypted, it is vulnerable to disclosure. Even if the operating system enforces permissions on data access, an adversary can read storage media directly, thereby circumventing operating system controls.

If data at rest is unencrypted, it is vulnerable to disclosure. Even if the operating system enforces permissions on data access, an adversary can read removable media directly, thereby circumventing operating system controls. Encrypting the data ensures confidentiality is protected even when the operating system is not running. Windows Phone 8.1 platform cannot enforce encryption for removable media, so the use of removable media must be disabled. This alternative mitigation, prohibiting the use of removable storage media using an IA control, eliminates the threat of data vulnerabilities since no data can be stored on such media.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #23",

      "description": "For consumer use, the ability to turn off or suspend a VPN connection may be useful in cases of bypassing server issues or decreasing battery utilization, but, in a DoD environment, a VPN connection needs to be retained to provide a consistent secure tunnel for communications with DoD networks. Therefore, disabling the ability for a user to be able to turn off VPN makes it more difficult for an adversary to capture network traffic.\n\nFor Windows Phone 8.1, this requirement is needed to prevent access to cloud services like OneDrive by OS applications and components such as:\n\nOffice Hub/Applications\nOneNote\nBackup\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42",

Passwords with sequential or repeating numbers or alphabetic characters (e.g., 456, 987, 222, abc, ddd) are considered easier to crack than random patterns. Therefore, disallowing sequential or repeating numbers or alphabetic characters makes it more difficult for an adversary to discover the password.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42",

The Cortana personal assistant can perform a number of voice-related queries and actions that can aid productivity but also allows some of its actions to be done while the device is locked.

This provides assurance that the required mobile OS security controls are being enforced and that the device user or an adversary has not modified or disabled the controls. If a user has the ability on their device to manually unenroll from MDM management, this removes all IA controls and exposes the device and the user to a number of threat vectors and takes them out of compliance.

But, if those same documents can be shared to public locations through email and cloud storage services, data leakage scenarios are possible, enabling sensitive data to be shared outside of secure DoD locations. To mitigate these threats, the sharing capability of documents should be disabled to prevent this possibility.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42",

      "description": "Applications and OS processes have a capability to have telemetry data called Software Quality Metrics (SQM) that can send software instrumentation metrics to the SQM service and to the client to download client-specific control data. The protocol allows applications and operating system components to collect and send instrumentation metrics, including customer experience data, crash reports, and traces to a hosted service over HTTP/HTTPS. That data, while not including any privacy-sensitive information, could potentially contain information sensitive to DoD.

The use of an MDM allows an organization to assign values to security-related parameters across all the devices it manages. This provides assurance that the required mobile OS security controls are being enforced and that the device user or an adversary has not modified or disabled the controls.

OS updates need to be a trusted process to prevent compromise of OS code, drivers, code signing, and malware injection. That process needs to be delivered over a securely encrypted and mutually authenticated method. If the MOS update process security cannot be documented, then the ability to disable updates or manage their availability by MDM is an acceptable option. The UBE action on the mobile device ensures that all approved (whitelist) apps will receive important functional and security updates, in addition to system security updates.\n\nSFR ID: FMT_SMF.1.1 #42",

A VPN can be configured to time out when idle, which, depending on the configuration for a triggered connection, might enable scenarios where the VPN is not on and unprotected access to the Internet is possible.
