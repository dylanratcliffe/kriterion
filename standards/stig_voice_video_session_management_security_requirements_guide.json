Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained. Voice video session managers must track periods of user inactivity and disable accounts after 35 days of inactivity. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be misused, hijacked, or data compromised.\n\nDoD has determined that 35 days is the appropriate time period of inactivity for Inactive accounts. Therefore, systems with a per user paradigm of management would apply.",

The H.323 protocol suite relies on the H.235 series, which describes security within H.323, including security for both signaling and media. For SIP protocol, the DoD has created the AS-SIP protocol, which provides for implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS), Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP), reliance on Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for media streams, and Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for traffic management through priority packet routing.
