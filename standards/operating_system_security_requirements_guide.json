Examples include, but are not limited to using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as, multiple servers.\n\nEnterprise environments make user account management challenging and complex.

Active users take notice of system and data conditions and are usually the first to notify systems administrators when they notice a system or application related anomaly pertaining to their own account. Inactive user accounts pose a risk to systems and applications. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.  \n\nThere is a risk that inactive accounts can potentially obtain and maintain undetected access to an application.
