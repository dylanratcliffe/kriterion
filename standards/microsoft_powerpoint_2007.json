To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax.\n\nThis functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by 2007 Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a webpage).
