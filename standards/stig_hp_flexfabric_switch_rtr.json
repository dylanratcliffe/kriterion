Without verifying the destination address of traffic coming from the site's AG, the perimeter router could be routing transit data from the Internet into the NIPRNet. This could also make the perimeter router vulnerable to a DoS attack as well as provide a backdoor into the NIPRNet.

Most ISPs use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to share route information with other autonomous systems, that is, any network under a different administrative control and policy than a local site.

This causes a DoS on the network that allocated the block of addresses and may cause a DoS on the network that is inadvertently advertising it as the originator.

The management interface can be a true out-of-band management interface or a standard interface functioning as the management interface.

Since all management traffic is immediately forwarded into the management network, it is not exposed to possible tampering. The separation also ensures that congestion or failures in the managed network do not affect the management of the device. If the device does not have an out-of-band management port, the interface functioning as the management interface must be configured so that management traffic, both data plane and control plane, does not leak into the managed network and that production traffic does not leak into the management network.",

      "description": "A compromised host in an enclave can be used by a malicious actor as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third parties. This is a common practice in \"botnets\", which are a collection of compromised computers using malware to attack (usually DDoS) other computers or networks. DDoS attacks frequently leverage IP source address spoofing, in which packets with false source IP addresses send traffic to multiple hosts, which then send return traffic to the hosts with the IP addresses that were forged. This can generate significant, even massive, amounts of traffic. Therefore, protection measures to counteract IP source address spoofing must be taken.\n\nThe router must not accept any outbound IP packets that contain an illegitimate address in the source address field by enabling Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) strict mode or by implementing an egress ACL. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) provides an IP address spoof protection capability. When uRPF is enabled in strict mode, the packet must be received on the interface that the device would use to forward the return packet.",

Packet flooding DDoS attacks are referred to as volumetric attacks and have the objective of overloading a network or circuit to deny or seriously degrade performance, which denies access to the services that normally traverse the network or circuit. Volumetric attacks have become relatively easy to launch using readily available tools such as Low Orbit Ion Cannon or by botnets. \n\nMeasures to mitigate the effects of a successful volumetric attack must be taken to ensure that sufficient capacity is available for mission-critical traffic. Managing capacity may include, for example, establishing selected network usage priorities or quotas and enforcing them using rate limiting, Quality of Service (QoS), or other resource reservation control methods. These measures may also mitigate the effects of sudden decreases in network capacity that are the result of accidental or intentional physical damage to telecommunications facilities (such as cable cuts or weather-related outages).",

      "description": "The Route Processor (RP) is critical to all network operations because it is the component used to build all forwarding paths for the data plane via control plane processes. It is also instrumental with ongoing network management functions that keep the routers and links available for providing network services. Any disruption to the Route Processor or the control and management planes can result in mission-critical network outages. \n\nA DoS attack targeting the Route Processor can result in excessive CPU and memory utilization. To maintain network stability and Route Processor security, the router must be able to handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to the Route Processor. In the past, one method of filtering was to use ingress filters on forwarding interfaces to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces grows and the size of the ingress filters grow. Control plane policing increases the security of routers and multilayer switches by protecting the Route Processor from unnecessary or malicious traffic. Filtering and rate limiting the traffic flow of control plane packets can be implemented to protect routers against reconnaissance and DoS attacks, allowing the control plane to maintain packet forwarding and protocol states despite an attack or heavy load on the router or multilayer switch.",

Additionally, unrestricted traffic may transit a network, which uses bandwidth and other resources.\n\nTraffic can be restricted directly by an ACL (which is a firewall function) or by Policy Routing. Policy Routing is a technique used to make routing decisions based on a number of different criteria other than just the destination network, including source or destination network, source or destination address, source or destination port, protocol, packet size, and packet classification. This overrides the router's normal routing procedures used to control the specific paths of network traffic. It is normally used for traffic engineering, but can also be used to meet security requirements; for example, traffic that is not allowed can be routed to the Null0 or discard interface. Policy Routing can also be used to control which prefixes appear in the routing table.\n\nTraffic can be restricted directly by an ACL (which is a firewall function), or by Policy Routing.

Controlling the flow of network traffic is critical so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data. An example of a flow control restriction is blocking outside traffic claiming to be from within the organization. For most routers, internal information flow control is a product of system design.",

Many attacks focused on CPU load and line-card overload can be prevented by implementing GTSM on all eBGP speaking routers. GTSM is based on the fact that the vast majority of control plane peering is established between adjacent routers; that is, the eBGP peers are either between connecting interfaces or between loopback interfaces. Since TTL spoofing is considered nearly impossible, a mechanism based on an expected TTL value provides a simple and reasonably robust defense from infrastructure attacks based on forged control plane traffic.",

Limiting where, within the network, a given multicast group's data is permitted to flow is an important first step in improving multicast security. \n\nA scope zone is an instance of a connected region of a given scope. Zones of the same scope cannot overlap while zones of a smaller scope will fit completely within a zone of a larger scope. For example, Admin-local scope is smaller than Site-local scope, so the administratively configured boundary fits within the bounds of a site. According to RFC 4007 IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (section 5), scope zones are also required to be \"convex from a routing perspective\"; that is, packets routed within a zone must not pass through any links that are outside of the zone. This requirement forces each zone to be one contiguous island rather than a series of separate islands. \n\nAs stated in the DoD IPv6 IA Guidance for MO3, \"One should be able to identify all interfaces of a zone by drawing a closed loop on their network diagram, engulfing some routers and passing through some routers to include only some of their interfaces.\" Therefore, it is imperative that the network has documented their multicast topology and thereby knows which interfaces are enabled for multicast.

Protocol Independent Multicast traffic must be limited to only known PIM neighbors by configuring and binding a PIM neighbor filter to those interfaces that have PIM enabled. If a PIM neighbor filter is not applied to those interfaces that have PIM enabled, an unauthorized routers can join the PIM domain and discover and use the rendezvous points, and also advertise their rendezvous points into the domain.
