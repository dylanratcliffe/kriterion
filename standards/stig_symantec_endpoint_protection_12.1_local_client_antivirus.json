The collective intelligence is constantly being updated, more frequently than the typical daily antivirus signature files. With File Reputation lookup, a more real-time response to potential malicious code is realized than with the local-running antivirus software, since querying the cloud-based database when a file appears to be suspicious provides up-to-the-minute intelligence. This type of protection reduces the threat protection time period from days to milliseconds, increases malware detection rates and reduces downtime and remediation costs associated with malware attacks.
