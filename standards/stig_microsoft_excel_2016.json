For example, the URL http://www.wingtiptoys.com@example.com appears to open http://www.wingtiptoys.com but actually opens http://example.com. To protect users from such attacks, Internet Explorer usually blocks any URLs using this syntax.\n\nThis functionality can be controlled separately for instances of Internet Explorer spawned by Office applications (for example, if a user clicks a link in an Office document or selects a menu option that loads a website).

For detail on about obtaining and distributing certificates, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294922.

Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store.  Office 2016 still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Office and you upgrade to Office 2016, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. For more information about trusted publishers, see the Office Resource Kit.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Excel stores macros in the active workbook from which they are created. Note: In the user interface (UI), the \"Store macro in\" drop down list box in the Record Macro dialog box (Macros | Record Macro) allows users to choose whether to store the new macro in the current workbook, a new workbook, or their personal macro workbook (Personal.xlsb), a hidden workbook that opens every time Excel starts. By default, Excel displays the \"Store macro in\" box with \"This Workbook\" already selected in the drop-down list. If a user saves a macro in the active workbook and then distributes the workbook to others, the macro is distributed along with the workbook. If you enable this policy setting, Excel displays the \"Store macro in\" box with \"Personal Macro Workbook\" already selected. Users can still select one of the other two options in the drop-down menu.\n",

VSTO projects require access to the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, even though the projects do not use Visual Basic for Applications. Design-time support of controls in both Visual Basic and C# projects depends on the Visual Basic for Applications project system in Word and Excel. If you enable this policy setting, VSTO and other automation clients can access the Visual Basic for Applications project system in the specified applications. Users will not be able to change this behavior through the \"Trust access to the VBA project object model\" user interface option under the Macro Settings section of the Trust Center. If you disable this policy setting, VSTO does not have programmatic access to VBA projects. In addition, the \"Trust access to the VBA project object model\" check box is cleared and users cannot change it.  Note: Disabling this policy setting prevents VSTO projects from interacting properly with the VBA project system in the selected application. If you do not configure this policy setting, automation clients do not have programmatic access to VBA projects. Users can enable this by selecting the \"Trust access to the VBA project object model\" in the \"Macro Settings\" section of the Trust Center. However, doing so allows macros in any documents the user opens to access the core Visual Basic objects, methods, and properties, which represents a potential security hazard.\n",

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for determining how the specified applications will warn the user about macros: - Disable all with notification:  The application displays the Trust Bar for all macros, whether signed or unsigned. This option enforces the default configuration in Office. - Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified. - Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users. - Enable all macros (not recommended):  All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected. If you disable this policy setting, \"Disable all with notification\" will be the default setting. If you do not configure this policy setting, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking \"Enable Content\" on the Trust Bar.  If the user clicks \"Enable Content\", then the document is added as a trusted document. Important: If \"Disable all except digitally signed macros\" is selected, users will not be able to open unsigned Access databases. Also, note that Microsoft Office stores certificates for trusted publishers in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store. Earlier versions of Microsoft Office stored trusted publisher certificate information (specifically, the certificate thumbprint) in a special Office trusted publisher store. Microsoft Office still reads trusted publisher certificate information from the Office trusted publisher store, but it does not write information to this store. Therefore, if you created a list of trusted publishers in a previous version of Microsoft Office and you upgrade to Office, your trusted publisher list will still be recognized. However, any trusted publisher certificates that you add to the list will be stored in the Internet Explorer trusted publisher store.\n",
